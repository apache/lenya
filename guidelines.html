<h1>Apache Lenya project guidelines</h1> 
  
<p>
   This document provides the guidelines under which the Apache Lenya
   project operates. It defines the roles and responsibilities, who may vote,
   how voting works, how conflicts are resolved, etc.
   Apache Lenya is a project of The Apache Software Foundation
   (<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">ASF</a>) which is a
   non-profit corporation. As with all such organisations there are some
   procedures to be followed.
   The ASF website explains the
   operation and background of the ASF. These project guidelines supplement that
   ASF documentation. Normally these guidelines are not needed - the project
   just gets on with its day-to-day operation - but they enable
   all people to understand how the project operates.

<h2 class="h3">The mission of Apache Lenya</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
      The generation of open source content management solutions,
      maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

</div>

  
<a name="N1001E"></a><a name="way"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Open development</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
      Lenya is typical of Apache projects, in that it operates under a set of
      principles that encourage open development. There is no clear definition 
      (perhaps that is part of it) and it is ever-evolving. Each ASF project is different
      in its own way - there is healthy diversity rather than uniformity across all projects.
      The main principles are to facilitate open collaborative development, with respect for
      others; to ensure that there is a healthy community (even to give community issues
      higher priority than code issues); to use a consensus-based approach;
      to ensure that each
      <a href="#contribution">contributor</a> is recognised and
      feels a productive part of the community; to encourage diversity; to make the project a nice place to be.
    </p>
<p>
      Each project, as part of the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2004/board_minutes_2004_05_26.txt">resolution</a>
      that formed its Project Management Committee (<a href="#pmc">PMC</a>),
      creates its set of project guidelines intended to encourage open development and
      increased participation. These facilitate the project to conduct its main charge,
      which is the creation and maintenance of open-source software for distribution at no
      charge to the public with the purpose of its
      <a href="#mission">mission</a>.

<a name="N10082"></a><a name="pmc"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Project Management Committee (PMC)</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>The Apache Lenya project was established in spring 2003 and became a
      top-level project in September 2004.
      The Project Management Committee (PMC) was created by a
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2004/board_minutes_2004_09_22.txt">resolution</a>
      of the board of the Apache Software Foundation.
      See explanation of the role of the PMC in that resolution and also the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html">ASF Bylaws</a>
      and 
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc">How-it-works</a>.
    </p>
<p>The responsibilities of the PMC include:</p>
<ul>
      
<li>Be familiar with these project guidelines, and the
      ASF Bylaws, and with the ASF documentation and procedures
      in general.</li>
      
<li>Keep oversight of the commit log messages and ensure that
       the codebase does not have copyright and license issues.</li>
      
<li>Resolve license disputes regarding products of the project,
        including other supporting software that is re-distributed.</li>
      
<li>Decide what is distributed as products of the project.
        In particular all releases must be approved by the PMC.</li>
      
<li>Guide the direction of the project.</li>
      
<li>Strive for and help to facilitate a harmonious productive community.</li>
      
<li>Nominate new PMC members and committers.</li>
      
<li>Maintain the project's shared resources, including the
        codebase repository, mailing lists, websites.</li>
      
<li>Speak on behalf of the project.</li>
      
<li>Maintain these and other guidelines of the project.</li>
    
</ul>
<p>
      The PMC does have a private mailing list on which it can discuss
      certain issues. However this list is rarely used and every effort
      is made to conduct all discussion on the public mailing lists.
    </p>
<p>
      Membership of the PMC is by invitation only and must receive
      consensus approval of the active PMC members.
    </p>
<p>
      A PMC member is considered
      "emeritus" by their own declaration or by not contributing in
      any form to the project for over six months. An emeritus member may
      request reinstatement to the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to
      consensus approval of the active PMC members. Membership of the PMC can be
      revoked by unanimous consensus of all active PMC members (other than
      the member in question).
    </p>
<p>
      The chair of the PMC is appointed by the Board and is an officer of
      the ASF (Vice President). The chair has primary responsibility to the
      Board, and has the power to establish rules and procedures for the
      day-to-day management of the communities for which the PMC is
      responsible, including the composition of the PMC itself.
      The chair reports to the board every three months about the status of the
      project. The PMC may consider the position of PMC chair annually and 
      may recommend a new chair to the board.
      Ultimately, however, it is the board's responsibility who it chooses
      to appoint as the PMC chair.
      See further explanation of the role of the chair in the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html">ASF Bylaws</a>
      and the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#chair">PMC FAQ</a>
    
</p>
<a name="N100CF"></a><a name="report"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Quarterly reports to ASF Board</h3>
<p>
        Every three months, it is the responsibility of our PMC chair to
        send a report to the ASF Board. This is mainly concerned with the
        status of our community, but can also include the technical progress.
        Further details are in the "committers" SVN in the /board/ directory.
      </p>
<p>
        The minutes are available for each
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/calendar.html">
        board meeting</a>. Our reporting schedule is: Feb, May, Aug, Nov.
      </p>
<a name="N100E0"></a><a name="elect"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Electing new committers and PMC members</h3>
<p>
        We conduct the vote on the private PMC mailing list to enable a frank
        discussion.
        In most cases we will be inviting people to go straight from developer
        to PMC member, i.e. they simultaneously become committer and PMC
        member. However, there may be extraordinary cases where we want
        limited work-related commit access (not also a PMC member).
        This will be resolved during the discussion and vote.
        Notes about this process are in the "committers" svn in the
        pmc/lenya/ directory.

<a name="N100EB"></a><a name="decision"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Decision making</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
      Different types of decisions require different
      forms of approval. For example, the previous section describes
      several decisions which require "consensus approval". This
      section defines how voting is performed, the types of approval, and which
      types of decision require which type of approval.
    </p>
<p>
      Most day-to-day operations do not require explicit voting - just get on
      and do the work. See the "Lazy approval" type described below.
    </p>
<a name="N100F7"></a><a name="voting"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Voting</h3>
<p>
        Certain actions and decisions regarding the project are made by votes
        on the project development mailing list. Where necessary,
        PMC voting may take place on the private PMC mailing list.
      </p>
<p>
        Votes are clearly indicated by subject line starting with [VOTE].
        Discussion and proposal should have happened prior to the vote.
        Voting is carried out by replying to the vote mail. 
        See <a href="#procedure">voting procedure</a> below.
        Votes are expressed using one of the following symbols:
      </p>
<table class="ForrestTable" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4">
        
<tr>
          
<td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>+1</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            "Yes," "Agree," or "the action should be
            performed." In general, this vote also indicates a willingness
            on the behalf of the voter to assist with "making it happen".

<td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>+0</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            This vote indicates a willingness for the action under
            consideration to go ahead. The voter, however will not be able
            to help.
          </td>

<td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>-0</strong></td>

            All vetoes must
            contain an explanation of why the veto is appropriate. Vetoes with
            no explanation are void. It may also be appropriate for a -1 vote
            to include an alternative course of action.

<p>
        All participants in the project are encouraged to show their
        preference for a particular action by voting. When the votes are
        tallied, only the votes of PMC members are binding. Non-binding
        votes are still useful to enable everyone to understand the
        perception of an action by the wider community.
      </p>
<p>
        Voting can also be applied to changes made to the project codebase. These
        typically take the form of a veto (-1) in reply to the commit message
        sent when the commit is made.

            product). The higher threshold is designed to ensure such changes
            are strongly supported. To pass this vote requires at least 2/3 of

<h3 class="h4">Vetoes</h3>
<p>
        A valid veto cannot be over-ruled, it can only be withdrawn by its issuer.
        Any veto must be accompanied by reasoning and be prepared to defend it.
      </p>
<p>
        The validity of a veto, if challenged, can be confirmed by anyone who
        has a binding vote. This does not necessarily signify agreement with the
        veto - merely that the veto is valid. In case of disputes about whether
        a veto is valid, then opinion of the PMC chair is final.
      </p>
<p>
        If you disagree with a valid veto, then you must engage the person
        casting the veto to further discuss the issues. The vetoer is obliged
        to vote early and to then work with the community to resolve
        the matter.
      </p>
<p>
        If a veto is not withdrawn, the action that has been vetoed must
        be reversed in a timely manner.

<h3 class="h4">Voting timeframes</h3>
<p>
        Votes are normally open for a period of one week to allow all active voters
        time to consider the vote. If the vote has not achieved a quorum,
        then it can be extended for another week. If still no quorum, then
        the vote fails, and would need to be raised again later.
        Votes relating to code changes are not subject to a strict timetable,
        but should be made as timely as possible.
      </p>
<a name="N102DF"></a><a name="procedure"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Voting procedure</h3>
<p>
        Discussion about the topic would have already happened in a [Proposal]
        email thread to express the issues and opinions. The [Vote] thread is
        to ratify the proposal.
      </p>
<p>
        The instigator sends the Vote email to the dev mailing list.
        Describe the issue with no ambiguity and in a positive sense.
        Define the date and time for the end of the vote period.
      </p>
<p>
        Votes are expressed by replying email using the
        <a href="#voting">voting symbols</a> defined above.
        Voters can change their vote during the timeframe.
        At the end of the vote period, the instigator tallies the number of
        final votes and reports the results.

<p>
        For breakdown situations and those requiring unanimous consensus,
        if this consensus cannot be reached within the extended timeframe,
        then the Board expects the chair to act as the officer of the
        Foundation and make the ultimate decision.

<a name="N102FE"></a><a name="communication"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Communication channels</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
      The primary mechanism for communication is the mailing lists.
      Anyone can participate, no matter what their time zone.
      A reliable searchable archive of past discussion is built.
      Oversight is enabled. Many eyes ensures that the project evolves
      in a consistent direction.
    </p>
<p>
      All decisions are made on the "dev" mailing list.
    </p>
<p>
      The main channel for user support is the "user" mailing list.
      As is usual with mailing lists, be prepared to wait for an answer.
    </p>
<p>
      Occasionally we will use other communication channels such as IRC.
      These are used only for a specific purpose and are not permanently
      available. This policy ensures that solutions are available in the
      mailing list archives and enables people to respond at whatever time
      that they choose. Permanent IRC channels are poor from a community-building
      point-of-view, as they tend to create time-zone based cliques.
      So we don't.
    </p>
<p>
      Similarly, private discussions are discouraged. The rest of the community
      would not benefit from the understanding that is developed.
      Off-list discussions put too much load on overworked volunteers.

<h2 class="h3">Code management</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>Development on the Lenya codebase happens on the trunk, unless a vote to create a branch 
       has passed. Experimental code not immediately intended for merging into trunk may 
       be commited to the sandbox. In order to prevent a code graveyard, sandbox contents will 
       be reviewed every 6 months and either merged into trunk, promoted to their own top-level directory, 
       or deleted. At any one time, the Lenya project maintains one release branch. At appropriate 
       times, the Lenya project may cut a new release branch from trunk, and retire the previous one. 
       Old release branches are kept in SVN, but are clearly marked as unmaintained both in SVN and on the web site.
    </p>
<p>
      The term "patch" has two meanings: Developers provide a set of changes
      via our <a href="community/index.html">issue tracker</a> marked for inclusion,
      which will be applied by a committer. Committers apply their own work
      directly, but it is still essentially a patch.
    </p>
<p>
      We use the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#CommitThenReview">Commit-then-review</a>
      method for decision-making about code changes by commiters on trunk, and <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#ReviewThenCommit">Review-then-Commit</a>
      on the release branch. Please refer to that
      glossary definition. Note that it does not preclude the committer
      from making changes to patches prior to their commit, nor mean that the
      committer can be careless. Rather it is a policy for decision-making. 
      Patches from non-commiters are applied according to the same rules by a commiter.
    </p>
<p>
      There is an important issue where both developers and committers need
      to pay special attention: "licenses". We must not introduce licensing
      conditions that go beyond the terms of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache License</a>.
      If such issues do creep in to our repository, then we must work as
      quickly as possible to address it and definitely before the next release.
    </p>
<p>
      There are some other problem areas:
      What should a committer do if the patch is sloppy, containing inconsistent
      whitespace and other code formatting, which mean that actual changes are not
      easily visible in the svn diff messages. What if there is poorly constructed
      (yet working) xml or java code? What if the new functionality is beyond the
      scope of the project? What if there is a better way to do the task? What if
      the patch will break the build, thereby preventing other developers from
      working and causing an unstable trunk?
    </p>
<p>
      The committer has various options: ask the developer to resubmit the patch;
      change the patch to fix the problems prior to committing; discuss the
      issues on the dev list; commit it and then draw attention to the
      issues so that the rest of the community can review and fix it.
      A combination of these options would appear to be the best approach.
      Please aim to not break the build, or introduce license problems, or make
      noisy changes that obscure the real differences.
    </p>
<p>
      Committers should not be afraid to add changes that still need attention.
      This enables prompt patch application and eases the load on the individual
      committer. An interesting side-effect is that it encourages community growth.

<a name="N10340"></a><a name="contribution"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Contribution and acknowledgement</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
      Some <a href="#way">principles</a> of open development at ASF are to ensure that each
      contributor is recognised and feels a productive part of the community, and to
      encourage diversity, respect, and equality.
      Key to this is the recognition of contributions from individuals
      in a manner that also recognises the community effort that made it all
      possible. It is important to remember that there is no concept of
      individual leadership. See the discussion of
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy">meritocracy</a>
      and other sections of the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">How the ASF works</a> document.
    </p>
<p>
       In an Open Source Project, or more importantly, a project developed
       using an open process, such as Apache Lenya, most contributions of actual
       code are supported by, or at least *should* be supported by, design
       discussion, oversight, testing, documentation, bug fixes and much more.
       No code contribution is an independent unit of work (or should not be).
       It is therefore impossible to credit individual contributors, it is
       simply unmanageable, even if it is possible to identify each part of a
       contribution.
    </p>
<p>
      At Apache Lenya we use the following method to provide recognition:
    </p>
<ul>
      
<li>
        All developers encourage other developers to participate on the
        mailing lists, treat each other with respect, and openly collaborate.
        This enables the contributors to feel a part of the project and shows
        that their discussion and ideas are valuable. These replies enhance
        the presence of their name in the email archives and search engines.
      </li>
      
<li>
        Encourage contributors to add patches via the
        <a href="community/index.html">issue tracker</a>. This also enables clear
        tracking of the issue and by default specifically shows who was the
        contributor.
      </li>
      
<li>
        When committers apply the patch, they refer to the issue number
        and the contributor's name. This enables linkage between the issue
        tracker and the Subversion history. It adds the contributor's name
        to the mail archives.
      </li>
      
<li>
        Committers apply patches as soon as possible. This keeps the contributor
        enthused and shows them that their work is valuable. Plus, it reduces the risk of bit rot,
        ie, patches that no longer cleanly apply due to unrelated code changes.
      </li>
      
<li>
        Committers write descriptive commit messages, which are then aggregated into 
        a top-level <a href="changes.html">changes</a> document. This enables linkage
        to the relevant issue and shows the contributor's name. It also shows
        the name of the committer who did the work to add the patch.
      </li>
      
<li>
        The existing PMC will notice new contributors who are committed. It eventually
        <a href="#elect">invites</a> them to become new committers/PMC members. See the 
        <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/committed.html">forrest notes</a> about this topic.
      </li>
      
<li>
        Committers/PMC members are
        <a href="community/acknowledgements.html">listed</a>.
      </li>
    
</ul>
<p>
      As discussed above, there is no specific documentation which lists each
      contributor and their work. For those who are interested there are various
      mechanisms: Use general internet search services; use search services provided
      by various third-party mail archives; search the "svn" mailing list using
      committer IDs and using contributor names; browse the
      <a href="changes.html">changes</a> page; use 'svn log' and 'svn blame'.
