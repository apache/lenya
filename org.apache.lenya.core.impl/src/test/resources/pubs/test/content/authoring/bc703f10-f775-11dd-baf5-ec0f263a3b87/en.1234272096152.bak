    <title>Lenya Tutorial</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Tutorial</h1>

    <p>This tutorial gives you a short introduction into the Apache
    Lenya content management system. We'll look at a typical use case
    where we create a new document, edit and publish it.</p>

    <h2>Creating a new document</h2>

    <p>To create a new document, go to the <code>File -> New
    XHTML Document</code> menu entry. You'll get a new screen that asks you
    for an id and a name for this new document. The id will be used
    internally as an identifier for the document and the name will be
    used in the navigation. Let's use "helloworld" as id and "Hello World" as the
    name of the new document. Now press <code>Create</code>. You will
    be redirected back to the page where you originally invoked the
    creation and you'll notice that the new document "Hello World" now shows
    up as a sub-document of the Tutorial document in the
    navigation.</p>

    <p>This illustrates the fact that a new document is always created
    as a sub-document of the document you're currently looking at. You
    also notice how the navigation is built automatically.</p>

    <h2>Editing a document</h2>

    <p>To look at the newly created document click on the "Hello World" entry
    in the navigation. You'll notice that the "Hello World" document already
    contains some content. It was created from a sample XML
    document. To change this sample content you will have to edit the
    document. You can pick on of the following web-based WYSIWYG
    editors:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Kupu: This is a good choice for users of Internet Explorer.</li>
      <li>BXE: This is a good choice for users of Mozilla.</li>
      <li>HTML Forms: This is a good choice for users of Mosaic ;-)</li>
      <li>One Form: For the power user who needs all the control</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pick your choice of editor (based on your platform) and start
    editing the newly created document by selecting the
    <code>Edit->Edit with BXE</code> menu button. The Lenya menu will
    disappear and the Bitflux toolbar will appear instead. You can use
    the right mouse button to get a context sensitive menu from where
    you can copy, cut and paste. You're also able to insert new
    elements into the document from the context sensitive menu. Once
    you're done with all your changes, press
    <code>Save&amp;Exit</code> to get back. You'll see your changes in
    the document.</p>
    
    <h2>Lenya Meta Data</h2>
    
    <p>The LenyaMetaDataGenerator lets you receive the meta data for any given document. In
      this pub there is an example in the sitemap.xmap (pattern="meta") it only should
      demonstrate one possible usage (you would need to edit this match for your own use case).
      See the meta data from this page with <a href="meta?docid=/tutorial&amp;lang=en">
      meta?docid=/tutorial&amp;lang=en</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Publishing a document</h2>

    <p>Once you are satisfied with the content of the document you
    want to publish it to make it visible in the live area.</p> 

    <h3>Workflow</h3>

    <p>The default publication has a simple workflow configured which
    involves an author and a reviewer. The author creates and edits a
    new document and submits it for approval. The reviewer (obviously
    :-)) reviews the document and publishes it so that it will appear
    on the live site.

    The user lenya (which you are probably currently logged in as) has
    the role edit, i.e. he can create new documents and submit them
    for approval (with <code>Workflow->Submit for review</code>). The
    user alice has the role review which allows her to approve,
    i.e. publish documents.</p>

    <p>In order to publish your newly created document simply press
    <code>Workflow->Sumbit</code> (as user lenya) to submit the
    current document for approval. Now log out
    (<code>File->Logout</code>), log back in as alice (use the same
    password as for user lenya) and publish the current document by
    selecting <code>Workflow->Publish</code>. You will get a
    confirmation screen where you confirm your intention to publish
    the document "Hello World" by pressing <code>Publish Now</code>. You might
    have to publish the parent document ("Tutorial") first, as the
    "Hello World" document will not be published if the parent document is not
    in the live area yet.</p> <p>To check how the "Hello World" document looks
    like in the live site click on the <code>live</code> tab in the
    Lenya menu. This will open a new browser window showing you the
    live site.</p>
    
    <h2>Scheduling</h2>
    
    <p>Apache Lenya allows you to publish a document at a specific
    date. To do this select the <code>Workflow->Publish</code> menu
    entry. Now instead of pressing <code>Publish</code> immediately,
    specify the date and the time at which you wish to publish the
    document first. Your document will be published at
    the specified date. Use the <code>Scheduler</code> tab in the site
    area to see the pending tasks and their status.</p>

    <h2>Revision Control</h2>

    <p>Every time you edit a document and exit the editor a new
    revision of the document is stored. Old versions of the document
    are kept and you can go back to an older version if you want to
    undo some of the changes you applied to it. To see all available
    versions of the current document press
    <code>Tools->Rollback</code>. This will give you a list of all
    previous versions. You can view a specific old version or rollback
    to a specific old version by clicking on the appropriate links.</p>
