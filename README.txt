  Hardware Requirements
  ---------------------

  It's advisable to have a lot of RAM and a fast CPU.
  You will be able to develop without a problem when you have
  1GB of RAM and a 1GHz Processor. The system is also
  running pretty fast when you have a Laptop with 96MB RAM and a 255MHz
  processor. But the startup will take quite some time and
  developing is very hard.



  Installation Instruction
  ------------------------

  Read the INSTALL-BIN file in this directory for the installation of the binary version (war).
  Read the INSTALL-SRC file in this directory for the installation of the source version.
