  About Apache Lenya
  ------------------

  Apache Lenya is a Java-based Open-Source Content Management System. 
  It is based on open standards such as XML and XSLT. One of its core 
  components is Cocoon from the Apache Software Foundation.

  Apache Lenya supports inline WYSIWYG editors. Your site editors do not 
  have to learn XML. This is possible thanks to the support of XML, 
  XSLT and XML Schema on the client side. An administration interface 
  allows advanced users to monitor the CMS, and perform configuration 
  tasks.
