  Note on Incubation
  ------------------

  Apache Lenya is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation, sponsored by the ASF's Cocoon project. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
