  |  Apache Lenya is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache          | 
  |  Software Foundation, sponsored by the ASF's Cocoon project.            |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until            |
  |  a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,    |
  |  and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent     |
  |  with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not     |
  |  necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the       |
  |  code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed   |
  |  by the ASF.                                                            |

  About Apache Lenya
  ------------------

  Apache Lenya is a Java-based Open-Source Content Management System. 
  It is based on open standards such as XML and XSLT. One of its core 
  components is Cocoon from the Apache Software Foundation.

  Lenya supports inline WYSIWYG editors. Your site editors do not 
  have to learn XML. This is possible thanks to the support of XML, 
  XSLT and XML Schema on the client side. An administration interface 
  allows advanced users to monitor the CMS, and perform configuration 
  tasks.
