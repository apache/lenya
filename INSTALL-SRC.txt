   +---------------------------+



1) Set your JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME and PATH environment, e.g.

   [unix] 
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/j2sdk1.4.2
   export ANT_HOME=/usr/local/jakarta-ant-1.5.1
   export PATH=$ANT_HOME/bin:$PATH


2) Copy "build.properties.sample" to "build.properties"

3) Edit build.properties:

   The most important parameter to update is "cocoon.webapp.dir", which tells
   where the Cocoon webapp directory is located (first you need to build Cocoon).

   If you want to run Lenya on Tomcat then you should update the following
   parameters: "install.dir" and "cache.dir"

4) Build Lenya by typing

   ant install

5) Copy endorsed libraries

6) Start up Tomcat, e.g.

   [unix]
   /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.24-LE-jdk14/bin/startup.sh

7) Open http://localhost:8080/lenya/ with your browser
