    <h1>Resource Type Examples</h1>

<p>
The default publication comes with the <a href="/default/authoring/doctypes/xhtml-document.html">XHTML resource type</a>,
the <a href="/default/authoring/doctypes/links.html">Links resource type</a>,
the <a href="/default/authoring/doctypes/opendocument.html">OpenDocument resource type</a> and
the <a href="/default/authoring/doctypes/cforms.html">CForms resource type</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>XHTML resource type</strong> is suitable for situations where
users ask for complete freedom on what information can be inserted
into a document. While this approach doesn't restrict you, it also
looses some of the major benefits of well defined document types.
</p>
    
<p>
The <strong>Links resource type</strong> is mainly to show that Lenya is able to handle
arbitrary resource types but can also be used for link-lists.
</p>
    
<p>
The <strong>OpenDocument resource type</strong> is a standardized XML-based
file format specification suitable for office applications and has been developed
by <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office">OASIS</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>CForms resource type</strong> is an example of how Lenya manages formular data
based on Cocoon's CForms in conjunction with Ajax.
