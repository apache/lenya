To publish from trunk/site-author/

Do once:
# Create $LENYA_DOCU/deploy.svn.settings file. These credentials
# are needed by forrestbot so that it can do your 'svn add'
# and 'svn commit' etc. to the lenya/site/ repository.
# The deploy.svn.settings file looks like:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project>
  <property name="deploy.svn.user" value="myApacheUsername"/>
  <property name="deploy.svn.password" value="myPassword"/>
</project>


# Make changes to sources, and then test, then commit.
# Use the forrestbot to build and then deploy to svn.apache.org ...

forrest -f publish.xml build
# ... verify files in build/lenya-docs
forrest -f publish.xml deploy -Ddeploy.svn.commit-message="my commit message"

Now the files are in SVN at lenya/site
Periodically the real website files are updated from there.
You do not have to do anything else.

----------------------
Note: The first time that you deploy, it will need to do
a long svn checkout first.

FIXME: That commit message technique does not work.
The second word is treated as an ant target to be called.
Just leave it out and forrestbot will use a default message.
