       Apache Documentation DTD (Version 2.0)
  
  PURPOSE:
    This DTD was developed to create a simple yet powerful document
    type for software documentation for use with the Apache projects.
    It is an XML-compliant DTD and it's maintained by the Apache XML
    project.
  
    The v2.x series of this DTD is an evolution of the 1.x series, incorporating
    lessons learned. Various new much-needed elements have been added, some unused
    features removed, and some renamed (link -> a). 2.x is not
    backwards-compatible, although a stylesheet can probably do the conversion.
  
  TYPICAL INVOCATION:
  
    <!DOCTYPE document PUBLIC
         "-//APACHE//DTD Documentation V2.1a//EN"
         "document-vxy.dtd">
  
    where
  
      x := major version
      y := minor version
  
  NOTES:
    Many of the design patterns used in this DTD were take from the
    W3C XML Specification DTD edited by Eve Maler <elm@arbortext.com>.
  
    Where possible, great care has been used to reuse HTML tag
    names to reduce learning efforts and to allow HTML editors to be
    used for complex authorings like tables and lists.
  
  EXTENSIBILITY:
    This DTD includes several empty placeholders that can be used to
    extend it. These placeholders are implemented with empty entities. Here
    is the list of those empty entities and what they are used for:
  
      - local.inline: this entity should contain extended definitions of
                      elements that can be used 'inline', or directly inside
                      the content. An example for this entity could be
  
                          <!ENTITY % local.inline "|citation">
  
      - local.blocks: this entity should contain extended definitions of
                      elements that behave as 'blocks', thus can be visually
                      rendered as areas on the canvas. An example for this
                      entity could be:
  
                          <!ENTITY % local.blocks "|poem">
  
      - local.sections: this entity should contain extended definitions of
                        elements that behave as 'sections', thus can be considered
                        containers of block-level elements. An example for
                        this entity could be:
  
                          <!ENTITY % local.sections "|chapter">
  
      - local.headers: this entity should contain extended definitions of
                       elements that behave as parts of the document header.
                       An example for this header could be:
  
                          <!ENTITY % local.headers ", notes?">
  
      - local.footers: this entity should contain extended definitions of
                       elements that behave as parts of the document footer.
                       An example for this header could be:
  
                          <!ENTITY % local.footers ", annotations*">
