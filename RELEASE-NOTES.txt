Release Notes -- Apache Lenya -- Version 1.4 Release Candidate 1

Introduction
------------

Apache Lenya is a Java-based Open-Source Content Management System.
It is based on open standards such as XML and XSLT. One of its core
components is Cocoon from the Apache Software Foundation.

Apache Lenya supports inline WYSIWYG editors. Your site editors do not
have to learn XML. This is possible thanks to the support of XML,
XSLT and XML Schema on the client side. An administration interface
allows advanced users to monitor the CMS, and perform configuration
tasks.
