-- Cocoon-2.1.11
Lenya 1.3 uses Cocoon-2.1.11.  A major bug from before Cocoon-2.1.6 survived through Cocoon-2.1.10 making those releases undesirable.

Repeat for Cocoon:
Download the Cocoon-2.1.11 release.

-- Cocoon in Eclipse
These instructions attempt to make an Eclipse project for Cocoon.  The instructions are incomplete because I could not discover the proper libraries to prevent errors.  The code may just be incompatible with Eclipse's convention of all classes resolving without errors.

Project name: Cocoon-2.1.11

Cocoon is missing several libraries.  Download and add to Cocoon's build path:
  commons-httpclient-3.1.jar - 
  commons-lang-2.3.jar - 
  htmlunit-1.14.jar - 
  jaxen-1.1.1.jar  - http://jaxen.codehaus.org/releases.html
  jcr-1.0.jar - http://www.day.com/maven/jsr170/jars/jcr-1.0.jar (This jar is also found buried in a download from Sun with a misleading name.)
Remove source from the build path.
  src/jdk1.3/java
  src/blocks/slop

These may not be the correct libraries as Eclipse still finds errors.

---  Java version error
JRE: Must be above 1.4 or will error:
Access restriction: the method ___ from the type ___ is not accessible due to restriction on required library rt.jar

Install and configure j2sdk1.4.2_15

--- Finish Lenya in Eclipse

Copy Lenya13x/src/cocoon/
   local.blocks.properties
   local.build.properties
To Cocoon-2.1.11/

Run cocoon-2.1.11/build.bat

Add libraries to build path from:
lib/core 
lib/endorsed
tools/jetty/lib/servlet-2.3.jar
tools/lib/ant.jar
cocoon-2.1.11/build/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/*

Remove duplicate libraries keeping latest versions (higher numbers.)

Open Lenya13x/build.properties and verify cocoon.src.dir
Run Lenya13x/build.bat
Run Lenya13x/lenya.bat

Change the Problems filter to "description" "doesn't contain" "deprecated" (unless you are fixing these warnings.)
