  <page:title>It seems that Kupu is not built properly</page:title>
  <page:body>
    <div class="lenya-box">
      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are using a SVN checkout of Lenya, you need to run 
        <code>make</code> in the Kupu root directory or <code>./build.sh kupu</code> on Linux or <code>build.bat kupu</code> on Windows in the Apache Lenya source directory.
	In the case of Tomcat as servlet container one needs to run additionally <code>./build.sh install</code> resp. <code>build.bat install</code>.
        Make sure that <em>xsltproc</em> is installed on your system.
      </p> 
      <p>Lenya binary releases ship with Kupu already preconfigured.</p>
      <p>Many thanks to the <a href="http://kupu.oscom.org">Kupu community</a> for making this 
        great browser based XHTML WYSIWYG editor available. </p>
