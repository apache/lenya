DONE 20080127: Fix Publication Module loading and inheritance.  Each Publication should build structure once per restart.  
[Modules.java]
synchronize setting of static variables.
Move inherit to static (publication.module.name=publication.module.name).
Module variable inheritance must follow name changes (inherit="differentModuleName").
Fix getVariable() to use inherit.
New "inherit": publication.module -> list(array) of publication.module
There may be more than one publication.  Each Module inherits from only one Module name.
Use for both File and Variable inheritance.
[ModuleModule.java]
module variables: publication.xconf (implemented), then get defaults from module.xconf, follow inheritance until found.
DONE 20080127: Add reloadModules to publication. => Files are cached by filename so changes fo not require reset.  Filename cache cleared by reset using double-colon.
