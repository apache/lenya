Resource Types are simply special Modules.

The <module> element should contain attributes:
id - the type or doctype.  Defaults to the directory name if missing.
resource - the types for inheritance. Can be any other type.

The main types are:
"/xml" for XML Documents.
"/file" for binary files.
"/link" for links.
"/text" in development for non-XML text files.

XML Resource Types (inheriting from "/xml") will merge resource.xml when a Resource is edited, keeping existing values and adding new fields.  
Text fields should be children of root or children of root/lenya:meta.
Rich-text fields are defined as containing elements.  Example:
   <body><br/></body>
will display the Rich-text Editor.
There currently may only be one Rich-text Field.  (This limit will be removed soon.)
