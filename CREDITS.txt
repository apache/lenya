This is the file where major donations to the Lenya project are listed and it
should be used to give appropriate visibility to those inviduals, organizations
or companies that donated resources to the effort. This file wants to be one of
the ways the Lenya community pays back.

Lenya was originally started by Michael in early 1999 to manage the
content of the journal of pattern formation. Michael previously did
basic research in physics by writing computer simulations on dendritic
growth.

In early 2000 Michael co-founded Wyona (www.wyona.com), which
continued to develop Lenya on the basis of the interactive newspaper
edition of Neue Zürcher Zeitung (www.nzz.ch).  The name Lenya is a
combination of the names of his two sons Levi and Vanya.
