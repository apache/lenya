This is the file where major donations to the Lenya project are listed and it
should be used to give appropriate visibility to those inviduals, organizations
or companies that donated resources to the effort. This file wants to be one of
the ways the Lenya community pays back.

                     Lenya was originally started by Michael in early 1999 to 
                     manage the content of the Journal of Pattern Formation. 
                     Michael previously did basic research in physics by writing 
                     computer simulations on dendritic growth.

                     In early 2000 Michael co-founded Wyona (wyona.com), which
                     continued to develop Lenya on the basis of the interactive 
                     newspaper edition of Neue Zürcher Zeitung (nzz.ch). The name 
                     Lenya is a combination of the names of his two sons Levi and Vanya.
