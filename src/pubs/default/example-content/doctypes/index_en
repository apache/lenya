    <h1>Document Type Examples</h1>

<p>
The default publication comes with the <a href="doctypes/xhtml-document.html">XHTML Doctype</a>, the <a href="doctypes/links.html">Links Doctype</a>, the <a href="doctypes/opendocument.html">OpenDocument Doctype</a> and the <a href="doctypes/cforms.html">CForms Doctype</a>.
</p>

<p>
A tutorial on creating/adding new doctypes can be found <a href="tutorial/new_doctype.html">here</a>.
</p>
    
<p>
The <strong>XHTML Doctype</strong> is for situations where
users ask for complete freedom on what information can be inserted
into a document. While this approach doesn't restrict you, it also
looses some of the major benefits of well defined document types.
</p>
    
<p>
The <strong>Links Doctype</strong> is mainly to show that Lenya is able to handle
arbitrary doctypes but can also be used for link-lists.
</p>
    
<p>
The <strong>OpenDocument Doctype</strong> is a standardized XML-based file format specification suitable for office applications and has been developed by <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office">OASIS</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>CForms Doctype</strong> is an example of how Lenya manages formular data based on Cocoon's CForms in conjunction
with Ajax.
