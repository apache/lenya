    <h1>Lenya Tutorial - How to create a new doctype</h1>

    <p>NOTE: Also see the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lenya/AddingCustomDocType">Wiki</a></p>

    <h2>The standard way</h2>

    <p>
    Add a link where people can click on: <em>config/menus/menu.xsp</em>
    </p>

    <p>
    Create a usecase sitemap where the "flow" is defined: <em>usecase-create-my_doctype.xmap</em>
    </p>

    <p>
    Define what class shall be used for the actual creation: <em>config/doctypes/doctypes.xconf</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In many cases a new document is created based on a sample: <em>config/doctypes/samples/my_doctype.xml</em>
    The name of the sample needs to be configured within <em>config/doctypes/doctypes.xconf</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Add doctype such that XSLT can be found: <em>parameter-doctype.xmap</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Create XSLT: <em>xslt/my_doctype2xhtml.xsl</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    OPTIONAL: Create new menu: <em>menus.xmap</em>, <em>config/menus/my_doctype.xsp</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Create workflow: <em>config/workflow/my_doctype.xml</em>, <em>config/doctypes/doctypes.xconf</em>
    </p>
