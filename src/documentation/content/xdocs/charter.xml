<p>
The Apache Lenya Project is a community project developing open source content management solutions. 
</p><p>
With strong foundations in XML-based server-side web application frameworks,
like Apache Cocoon, the Apache Lenya Project consists of a group of people 
that share common values on collaboration-intensive and community-based
quality open source development. 
</p><p>
</p><p>
The Apache Lenya Project is proud to share these values with its parent organization: 
The Apache Software Foundation. The mission of the Apache Lenya Project project is:</p><p>
</p>
<ul>
   <li>to provide commercial-quality, high-performance, well-tested,
standards-based XML editing environments that are developed in an open and collaborative fashion.</li>
   <li>to add user-oriented functionality on top of the Cocoon framework and other Apache projects.</li>
   <li>to advance the state of the art of content management and structured text editing.</li>
</ul>
