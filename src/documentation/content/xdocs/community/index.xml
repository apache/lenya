    <title>Contribute to the Wiki</title>
    <p>The <a href="ext:wiki/lenya">Lenya Wiki</a> is the scratchpad for the
    Lenya documentation as well as a whiteboard that is used by the community
    to sketch out proposals about the further direction of the project.</p>

	<title>Contribute code</title>
  <note>Please use our <a href="site:issue.add">Bug tracker</a> to submit patches instead of sending them to the mailing list. 
    All our committers started in creating an account there ;-)<br/>
    </note>
	<p>
		You can contribute code as patch via our <a href="site:issue.add">Bug tracker</a>. 
		For this, you file a bug entry in Bugzilla, using the links provided below. 
		The bug entries in Bugzilla should provide a description of what the patch does, 
		and how to apply it. Any further discussion should occur on the Lenya Developer list (see <a href="site:ml">mailing lists</a>)
	</p>
	<section>
		<title>Preparing a Patch</title>
			<ul>
				<li>For general procedures please see the Cocoon documentation <a href="site:cocoon.howto.patch">How to Prepare a Patch</a> and 
          <a href="site:cocoon.howto.bugzilla">How to Contribute a Patch via Bugzilla</a>. 
          Note that the actual command to create the patch is <code>svn diff</code> (instead of <code>cvs diff -u</code> as 
          suggested in said documents).</li>
				<li>Make sure you follow the <a href="site:coding">coding guidelines</a>.</li>
				<li>Test your patch by applying it to a fresh checkout of Lenya. In Eclipse for instance, this is done by choosing "apply patch" in the team perspective.</li>
				<li>Follow this link to enter your patch in Bugzilla: <a href="site:issue.add">add a new patch</a>.</li>
