  </header> 
  <body> 
<p>
The following screenshots are meant for the evaluator in a hurry. For a much more complete impression
, <a href="ext:lenya.dist">download</a> the latest release and try it out yourself. You may also want
to try out the <a href="ext:lenya.demo">online demo</a>.

        <section id="site-assets">
      <title>Site management</title><p>
    The Apache Lenya site area is used to perform operations that concern multiple pages, like moving pages
    around, renaming sections of the site, etc. The site area gives a quick overview of the complete site.
    Detailed information about each page can be accessed by clicking on the relevant node in the tree
    structure at left. In this view, the asset management is shown. <br/><br/><img src="images/live/apache-lenya-site-assets.gif" alt="Screenshot of the Apache Lenya site area"/>

      <title>WYSIWYG editing</title><p>
    Apache Lenya comes with different editors for content editing. One of the more advanced ones is <a href="ext:bxe">BXE</a>. 
    Using BXE, you can edit arbitrary XML in WYSIWYG and validate your document against an Relax NG
    schema while it is being edited.
    BXE uses validation to restrict the editing choices instead of allowing free-form input and then
    generating validation errors on save (an approach that makes it different from most other editors).

      </p>
      <p>Another editor shipping with Apache Lenya is <a href="ext:kupu">Kupu</a>. Kupu is specialized for XHTML editing and works in Internet Explorer and Mozilla.

      </p>
      <p>Both editors are tightly integrated, and can of course access assets and links managed by Apache Lenya, as the following insert link popup shows.
