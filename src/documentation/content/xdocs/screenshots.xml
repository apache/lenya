<p>
The following screenshots are meant for the evaluator in a hurry. For a much more complete impression
of Apache Lenya, download the latest release and try it out yourself.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Apache Lenya authoring area is used to edit individual pages. The author browses through the authoring
    area just like a visitor to the web site would, by using the navigation of the site. The menu at the top of
    the screen is the only indication that you are inside the authoring environment, everything else is just
    like it appears on the live site. <br/><br/>

      <br/><br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>
    The Apache Lenya site area is used to perform operations that concern multiple pages, like moving pages
    around, renaming sections of the site, etc. The site area gives a quick overview of the complete site.
    Detailed information about each page can be accessed by clicking on the relevant node in the tree
    structure at left. <br/><br/><img src="images/live/apache-lenya-site-area.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Apache Lenya site area"/>
    <br/><br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>
    Apache Lenya comes with different editors for content editing. One of the more advanced ones is <link href="ext:bxe">BXE</link>. 
    Using BXE, you can edit arbitrary XML in WYSIWYG and validate your document against an Relax NG
    schema while it is being edited.
    BXE uses validation to restrict the editing choices instead of allowing free-form input and then
    generating validation errors on save (an approach that makes it different from most other editors).
