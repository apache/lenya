	<title>How to Send Notification Messages</title>
	
	<p>To send notification messages, use the <code>Notifier</code> component which is provided by the
	<code>notification</code> module. A shortcut to the <code>Notifier</code> functionality
	is offered by the <code>NotificationUtil</code> utility class. Here's an example how to use it:</p>
	
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
protected void notify(User sender, User recipient, document) {

    Identifiable[] recipients = { recipient };
    
    // compose message, using parameters for i18n
    
    String[] params = { document.getId() };
    Message message = new Message("document-was-published", params);
    
    // send message
    
    NotificationUtil.notify(this.manager, recipients, sender, message);
}
]]></source>

  <p>
    The message is sent to each particular recipient, translated using the recipient's locale.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The current implementation, <code>DefaultNotifier</code>, sends an email to each recipient.
    Future implementations could include a message list which is managed by the CMS and is
    presented to a user after she logs in.
  </p>
