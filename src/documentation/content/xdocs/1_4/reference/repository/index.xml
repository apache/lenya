      <title>Introduction</title>
      
      <p>
        The Lenya content repository is based on the <a href="http://www.jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr170/">Java Content Repository</a> API.

      <title>Repository Layout</title>
      
      <p>
        The JCR repository used by Lenya comprises a set of workspaces, each of which represent an area
        of the document structure. For each area that is declared by a publication, a repository workspace
        is created.
      </p>
      <p>
        Publications are orthogonal to workspaces. Each publication can declare its own set of areas.
        Thus, the set of workspaces in the Lenya repository derives from the union of all areas declared by publications.
