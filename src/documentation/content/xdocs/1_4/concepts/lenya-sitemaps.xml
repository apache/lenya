		<title>Overview of the Lenya Sitemaps</title>
	</header>
	<body>

		<section>
			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>Lenya is based on Apache Cocoon. To understand how Lenya works, you should have at least some basic
			Cocoon knowlege. Make sure you know what a Cocoon sitemap is and you understand matchers, generators,
			transformers and serializers at least.</p>
			<p>Lenya uses some more Cocoon components, but if you can spot the matchers, generators, transformers and
			serizalizers, you will be able to get a good first overview of the Lenya sitemaps.</p>
			<p>But Lenya is much more than just a collection of sitemaps and some XSLT stylesheets. Lenya builds on 
			the Cocoon foundation and extends the Cocoon framework with custom</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Matchers</li>
			<li>Actions</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Beyond these components, Lenya also defines two proprietary schemes:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>lenya:</li>
			<li>fallback:</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>These schemes are linked to a custom input module that comes with Lenya, the</p>
			<ul>
			<li>PageEnvelope input module</li>
			</ul>
