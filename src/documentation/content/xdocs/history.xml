<p>
Lenya was originally started by Michael Wechner in early 1999 to manage the
content of the journal of pattern formation. Michael previously did
basic research in physics by writing computer simulations on dendritic
growth.
</p>
<p>
In early 2000 Michael co-founded <link
href="ext:wyona">Wyona</link>, which continued to develop
Lenya on the basis of the interactive newspaper edition of <link
href="ext:nzz">Neue Z&#252;rcher Zeitung</link>.  The name
Lenya is a combination of the names of his two sons Levi and Vanya.
