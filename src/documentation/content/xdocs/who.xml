      <title>The Lenya Community</title>
      <p>
        The Lenya Project operates as a meritocracy: the more you do, the more
        responsibility you will obtain. This page lists all of the people who
        have gone the extra mile and are Committers. If you would like to get
        involved, the first step is to join the mailing lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course the committers are not the only people involved in the
        community. Thanks to the many people for their contributions of patches,
        assistance, ideas, and email discussion. Some are mentioned at the
        changes pages. See how we
        <a href="guidelines.html#contribution">acknowledge</a> contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please do not send emails directly to individual developers asking for
        free support - see the Important Notices at the
        <a href="site:ml">mailing lists</a> page.

        Strong type denotes "Project Management Committee
        (<a href="guidelines.html#pmc">PMC</a>) member". Emphasis type denotes
        "emeritus PMC member". See the <a href="guidelines.html#roles">ASF role
        definitions</a> for detailed role information. The actual list of PMC
        members is in the SVN "committers" repository at
        /board/committee-info.txt
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people were committers prior to Lenya becoming a top-level
        project and so gaining a PMC. They were not around since then, so have
        never been on the PMC. All new committers are
        <a href="guidelines.html#pmc-committers">encouraged</a> to be PMC
        members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Committers can be as active as they choose and there is no performance
        pressure from the project. For those who are interested in the work that
        each paticular committer has done, see the
        <a href="guidelines.html#contribution">acknowledgements</a> section.
