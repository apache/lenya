    <title>Adding a Mime Type How-To</title>
  </header>
    <body>

<p>Lenya comes with many mime types supported "off-the-shelf". However the list of mime types is not (and can not be) exhaustive. 
If you have a Mime-Type which is not yet known to Lenya, such as Avi Videos (Mime-type video/x-msvideo) that the content editors of your site insist on using, proceed as described here. </p>

<section><title id="head-a4bbfe45a08bfc3cc5d0cd1bcfff7fa83460fca6">Enabling the downloads</title>

<p>The resource types which are known to your Lenya installation are defined in the file <tt>lenya/resources.xmap</tt>. Add the new Mime-Type in here, for example for AVI this is:  
</p>
<pre>
          &lt;map:match pattern="*/*/**.avi"&gt;
            &lt;map:read src="pubs/{1}/resources/{2}/{3}.avi" mime-tyoe="video/x-msvideo" /&gt;
          &lt;/map:match&gt;

</pre>
<p>You probably need to restart your servlet container in order for the changes to take effect. </p>
<p>Now, visitors of your pages should be able to download objects of this mime-type. </p>

<p>In the asset handling, there are some restrictions as to what filetypes you are allowed to upload. If the file extension you require is not yet allowed, 
edit the file <tt>xslt/authoring/asset.xsl</tt> and add it to the list of types defined in <tt>&nbsp;&lt;xsl:param&nbsp;name="extensions"&nbsp;...</tt> </p>

<p>If you are using BXE, edit the file <tt>xslt/bxeng/asset.xsl</tt> and add it to the list of types defined in <tt>&lt;xsl:param&nbsp;name="extensions"&nbsp;...</tt> </p>
