      <p>
        Modules are packages providing a certain set of resources or 
        functionality. The aim of this section in the documentation is to group 
        the information needed to work with a certain module into one entry point.
      </p>
      <p>
        To learn how modules are implemented, refer to the <a href="site:modules">general modules documentation</a>.
