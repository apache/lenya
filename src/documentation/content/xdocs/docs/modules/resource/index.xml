        The <code>resource</code> module contains the "resource" resource type,
        it allows to store arbitrary media documents.

      <title>Resource Icons</title>
      <p>
        This module provides only one complete icon (the default one) out of the box.
        The default icon (<code>default_med.gif</code>) is a question mark. An "empty" version of
        this icon (without the question mark) can be found in the core
        (<code>webapp/lenya/resources/images/icons/empty-icon.png</code>).
        For all file extensions with no corresponding icon, an icon is generated
        dynamically by adding the first three letters of the extension as a label
        to the empty icon.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you can provide icons with a ASF style license we are happy 
        to add them to the module.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want your own set of icons, then please add them 
        to <code>$PUB_HOME/lenya/modules/resource/resources/icons/</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can download and extract e.g. the icon package from Wyona in your publication:
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve">https://svn.wyona.com/repos/public/lenya/modules-resource-icons.tar
user: anonymous
pass: anonymous</source>
