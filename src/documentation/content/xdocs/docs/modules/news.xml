    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      The news module provides a resoure type which displays a list of the document's children,
      in descending order of the creation date. The child documents are treated as news messages.
      The news can also be rendered as an RSS feed.

    <title>Formats</title>
    <p>
      The news resource type provides the following formats:
    </p>
  
    <dl>
      
      <dt>xhtml</dt>
      <dd>The usual XHTML page. It shows a list of the child documents, including the title and first paragraph.</dd>
      
      <dt>include</dt>
      <dd>An XHTML snippet. The view is equal to the <code>xhtml</code> format, but the content is
      included in an <code><![CDATA[<xhtml:div id="news"/>]]></code> element. This format can be used
      to include the news items in other pages, typically using CInclude.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>rss</dt>
      <dd>The RSS view of the news items.</dd>
      
      <dt>header</dt>
      <dd>
        The RSS header (<code><![CDATA[<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" ... />]]></code>),
        pointing to the RSS feed. This is used, e.g., for Firefox' "live bookmark" feature.
