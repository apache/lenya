	    <p>Link Managements deals with internal links, i.e. documents
	      that refer to other documents within the same publication. In Lenya 1.2, links
	      are rewritten each time the URL of the target document changes (see
	      section <a href="site:a-management-1">Link Management</a> in the Lenya 1.2 documentation).
	      This behaviour will probably not be ported to 1.4, since URL-based links will be replaced by
	      UUID-based links.

	    <title>Syntax for Internal Links</title>
	    
	    <p>
	      Until the UUID-based link syntax is introduced, internal links have the following syntax:
	    </p>
	    
	    <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[/<publication-id>/<area><document-url>]]></source>
	    
	    <p>
	      Examples:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><code>/default/authoring/doctypes/xhtml_en.html</code></li>
	      <li><code>/yourpub/live/news/2006-02-03.html</code></li>
	    </ul>
