    <faq id="i18n">
      <question> How to extend the i18n catalog for Lenya 1.4? </question>
      <answer>
        <p> In the default publication you can find 
          <code>pubs/default/lenya/resources/i18n</code>. That are the files 
          you need to edit if you wish to override it on a publication base. 
          </p>
        <p>However you can as well extend the catalog with modules, that you 
          can reuse in different publications. You need to add at least 
          <code>modules/{yourModule}/lenya/resources/i18n/cmsui.xml</code>.
          Don't forget to declare the module in <code>publication.xconf</code>
          so that the i18n catalog is detected.

      <question> Is it possible to override in BXE *only* a css style definition? </question>
      <answer>
        <p> Yes, this is possible.<br/> Just add and edit it like you need it 
          (have a look in the default pub): 
          <code>{pubid}/resources/misc/bxe/{ressourcetype}-bxe.css</code> </p>
