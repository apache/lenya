<section><title>Serving Static Resources</title> 
<p>Lenya now serves static resources out of the box. Publications can either
use these predefined mappings, or provide their own. The following MIME types
are handled:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CSS</li> 
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Images (GIF, JPEG and PNG)</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>Shockwave Flash (*.swf)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To use the built-in matching, these resources need to be stored in the
appropriate directories within a publication, and called with the proper
URLs.
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>MIME Type</td><td>Prefix</td><td>Directory</td></tr>
<tr><td>CSS</td><td>css/</td><td>resources/css/</td></tr>
<tr><td>Javascript</td><td>javascript/</td><td>resources/javascript/</td></tr>
<tr><td>Images</td><td>images/</td><td>resources/images/</td></tr>
<tr><td>PDF</td><td>pdf/</td><td>resources/pdf/</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flash</td><td>flash/</td><td>resources/flash/</td></tr>
</table>
<p>An image would thus be called with &lt;img src="images/logo.gif" /&gt;
You dont have to worry about absolute vs relative image paths as long
as you use URLs that follow this pattern.</p>
