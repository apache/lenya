      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Revision Controller controls the different reserved
      check-in and check-out of documents, the backup versions and the
      rollback. It is filesystem oriented</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Check-in / Check-out</title>
      <p>The 
      <link href="checkin.html">check-in</link>
      and 
      <link href="checkout.html">check-out</link>
      are reserved: a checked out document cannot be checked out by
      another user.</p>
      <p>A user "System" exists, who can force internally a checkin</p>
      <p>The different check-in/check-out states (the checkin/out,
      the time, the user's identity) of a document are stored in an
      xml file with a own markup language: the 
      <link href="rcml.html">RCML-file.</link></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Versions</title>
      <p>When a document is checked in, the old version of the
      document is copied ( 
      <link href="version.html">backup</link>
      )</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Rollback</title>
      <p>It is also possible to retrieve an old version with the 
      <link href="rollback.html">rollback</link>
      </p>
