<faq>
<question>How can I store my users in a database?</question>

<answer>
<p>You have to implement a <em>UserManager</em> wich accesses the
database to obtain the user information. Additionally, you have to
implement an <em>AccreditableManager</em> which uses this <em>UserManager</em>.
This <em>AccreditableManager</em> has to be declared in <code>cocoon.xconf</code>
and assigned to your <em>AccessController</em> in <code>lenya/pubs/mypub/config/ac/ac.xconf</code>.
