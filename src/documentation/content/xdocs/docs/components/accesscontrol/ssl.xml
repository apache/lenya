	<title>Introduction</title>
	<p>Pages or subtrees within Lenya can be protected by <em>SSL Encryption</em>. This allows you to protect 
	    these parts of your site that need it. Note that <em>SSL Encryption</em> is independent of 
	    <em>Authorization</em>. This means that you may have SSL-encrypted pages with or without access control.
	</p>
	
	<p>In a typical setup, you would have Apache HTTPd handle the SSL encryption and forward requests to Tomcat
	    as appropriate. This allows considerable flexibility with your setup, as you can make your SSL-encrypted
	    pages appear at a different location than the rest of your content. The setup here will explain you
	    how to achieve this.

		<p>To enable <em>SSL Encryption</em> for a subtree or a page, go to the <em>AC Live</em> 
		    or <em>AC Authoring</em> tabs in the Site area, and check the box that says <em>SSL Encryption</em>.</p>
