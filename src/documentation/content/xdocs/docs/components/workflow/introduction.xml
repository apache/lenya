<dt>Workflow Schema</dt>
<dd>A workflow schema defines a state machine (deterministic finite
automaton - DFA), consisting of 
  <ul>
    <li>states, including a marked initial state,</li>
    <li>transitions, and</li>
    <li>state variables.</li>
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Workflow Instance</dt>
<dd>A workflow instance is an incarnation of a workflow schema.
It consists of
<ul>
  <li>a current state,</li>
  <li>a mapping which assigns values to all state variables.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Transition</dt>
<dd>A transition describes the switching of a workflow instance
from one state to another. A transition has
<ul>
  <li>a source state,</li>
  <li>a destination state,</li>
  <li>an event,</li>
  <li>a set of conditions,</li>
  <li>a set of assignments.</li>
</ul>
Additionally, a transition can be marked as synchronized.
</dd>

<dt>History</dt>
<dd>The history of a workflow instance contains a list of all versions
of the instance. A version contains
<ul>
  <li>the state,</li>
  <li>the event that caused the transition (omitted in the first version),</li>
  <li>a description of the identity that invoked the event (username and IP address)</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>State Variable</dt>
<dd>A workflow schema can contain a set of state variables.
For each instance, the state variables hold certain values.
Values can be assigned during transitions, so a variable can change
its value when a transition fires. Currently, Lenya supports only
boolean state variables.
</dd>

<dt>Condition</dt>
<dd>
A condition can prevent a transition from firing, based on
the current situation.
Examples:
<ul>
  <li>Does the current user have a certain role on the current URL?
    (<code>RoleCondition</code>, included in Lenya)</li>
  <li>Does a certain state variable have a certain value
    (e.g., is the document published)?
    (<code>BooleanVariableCondition</code>, included in Lenya)</li>
  <li>Is the sun shining? (e.g., if the weather report may only
     be published on sunny days)</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Situation</dt>
<dd>A situation defines the state of the environment
of a workflow instance. Examples are:
<ul>
  <li>the current user ID</li>
  <li>the roles of the current user on the current URL</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<section><title>The State Machine</title>
<p>
When an event <em>e</em> is invoked on a workflow instance <em>I</em>, the following
algorithm is executed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The current state <em>s<sub>current</sub></em> is determined.</li>
  <li>The transition <em>t</em> from <em>s<sub>current</sub></em> to <em>s<sub>next</sub></em>
      which has the event <em>e</em> is determined.</li>
  <li>If <em>t</em> is not exactly defined, an exception is thrown.</li>
  <li>All conditions of <em>t</em> are validated.</li>
  <li>If all conditions are complied, the transition <em>t</em> fires:
  <ul>
    <li>All assignments of <em>t</em> are executed.</li>
    <li>The workflow instance <em>I</em> is advanced to the state <em>s<sub>next</sub></em>.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
