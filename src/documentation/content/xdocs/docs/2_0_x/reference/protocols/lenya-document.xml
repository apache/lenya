    <p>
      The <code>lenya-document:</code> protocol allows to access the source of a Lenya document <strong>by
      its UUID, publication ID, area, language and revision</strong>, regardless of the sitetree layout.
      All Lenya-internal links use it, so that links will not break when documents are moved around
      in the sitetree. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since it is such a fundamental concept, it is documented in detail under <a href="site:link-management">Link Management</a>.
