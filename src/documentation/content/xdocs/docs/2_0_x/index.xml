    <warning>
      Apache Lenya 2.0 is still under development and should not be used for production
    yet. A code freeze has been announced, and the release should be
      imminent.

    <note label="Help wanted!"> Since 2.0 is new and provides many 
      enhancements and new features, please help to document them with us. 
      Send documentation patches and use the Wiki. Thanks in advance :)</note>
    <p>
      More documentation (work in progress) can be found at the <a href="site:wiki/lenya/">Apache Lenya
    Wiki</a>. Please treat the Wiki with care for now, as much of the
      information there is outdated.
