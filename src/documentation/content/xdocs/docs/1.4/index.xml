           The 1.4. branch reflects our efforts to integrate Jackrabbit and building an even more flexible frameworks. 
           With the 1.4. branch we are trying to capsulate the functionalities of lenya into plugins. 
           This plugins then can be used in all following version independent from the lenya core.
