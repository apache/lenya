           In getting started with Lenya, one must learn not only a number of concepts, but a number of details as well. 
           The Components section will explain the building blocks that make up Lenya, such as the sitemap, publications, and tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
           You can find here release specific documentation. Although right now we have here the documentation mainly for 1.2.x..
           This is our stable releases and should be used for productiv environments.
        </p>
        <p>
           The 1.4. branch is in Draft status that means that it can be that are just RT (random thoughts) and not yet a documentation.
        </p>
<p>
More documentation (work in progress) can be found at the <link href="site:wiki/lenya/">Apache Lenya Wiki</link>.
