        <note> This is just a brainstorming draft not the actual finished documentation</note>
        <p>
           After capsulating all functionality into plugins, we can make flexible changes in 2.0 where we want to refactor the underlinying code base of the core. 
           The version 2.0 will be have the lenya core and a plugin base arround this way we hope to shorten the development time with lenya.
           The idea is that the user (or admin) can choose from a width range of plugins that he can use in his (her) application.
