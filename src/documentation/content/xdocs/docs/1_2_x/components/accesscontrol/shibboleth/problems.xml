    <title>Common Problems with the Shibboleth Setup</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    
    <p>
      The University of Leuven has published an excellent list of basic tests to verify a correct setup:
      <a href="http://shib.kuleuven.be/docs/idp/testing-idp-1.3.shtml"
        >Testing a Tomcat, CAS3 and Shibboleth IdP 1.3 setup</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Here's a list of typical Lenya-specific issues.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>SSLHandShakeException</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          This usually means that the Java VM can't verify your certificate.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After updating the Java VM to a new version, don't forget to re-add your
            server certificate to the default Java truststore. This applies to operating
            system updates as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lenya's LDAP configuration file <code>ldap.properties</code> overrides the default
            Java keystore location. If you use this setting, make sure to add the certificate
            to this keystore.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Login fails</dt>
      <dd>
        If you don't run the Lenya web application in the Tomcat root context, you'll have
        to set the <em>emptySessionPath</em> attribute of the connector to <em>true</em>.
        For more information, refer to the
        <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/http.html">Apache
          Tomcat Configuration Reference</a>.
