<p>
The following list describes the setup that is tested and recommended.
Please note that you can use other servlet containers as well, but Jetty and Tomcat are the tested
ones.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    <strong>Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition</strong> (required: J2SE 1.4.2 or newer)<br/>
    <link href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html</link>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    <strong>Apache Cocoon</strong> (required: Cocoon 2.1.5)<br/>
    <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/mirror.cgi">Cocoon download page</link>Note that Cocoon is needed when 
    building the source version of Lenya, but the resulting Lenya webapp is completely self contained 
    and therefore it does not need the Cocoon webapp to be installed. See the 
        <link href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon-lenya/FAQ">FAQ</link> for details of configuration 
    changes required when running multiple Cocoon based applications.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    <strong>(optional) Apache Tomcat</strong> for JDK 1.4 (recommended: 5.0.28 or newer)<br/>
    <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.cgi">Tomcat release builds</link> Note that
        Lenya ships with <link href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/">Jetty</link> and therefore does not 
        need a servlet container to be installed.<br/>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
