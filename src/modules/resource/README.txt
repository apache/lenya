README

Till now this module just provide *one* icon (the default one).
The default icon (default_med.gif) is a question mark.

If you can provide icons with a ASF style license we are happy 
to add them to the module.

Until then all icon calls like e.g. jpg_med.gif for a jpg image are 
substituted with the default icon if they cannot be found.

If you want your own set of icons, then please add them 
to {yourPub}/lenya/modules/resource/resources/icons/

You can download and extract e.g. the icon package from Wyona in your pub
https://svn.wyona.com/repos/public/lenya/modules-resource-icons.tar
