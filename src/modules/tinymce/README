TinyMCE Editor integration for Lenya 1.4


Installation:

- Download TinyMCE from http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/ and 
  unpack the archive in the resources directory of this module.
  That should give you a subdirectory named "tinymce"
  OR
  Download TinyMCE and unpack the archive in 
  {yourpub}/lenya/modules/tinymce/resource/

- Optionally download additional language packs and unpack them
  in the same place. (The new files will end up in tinymce/ as 
  well.)


- Add the appropriate permissions to 
  $YOURPUB/config/ac/usecase-permissions.conf, for example:

    <usecase id="tinymce.edit">
      <role id="admin" method="grant"/>
      <role id="edit" method="grant"/>
    </usecase>

  This will allow the "admin" and "edit" roles to access the 
  usecase.
 
- To add a menu entry, in $YOURPUB/config/publication.xconf
  add  <module name="tinymce"/> next to the other module 
  declarations. This does not work in the default publication, 
  because it creates its own custom menus. But for a quick test,
  you can append "?lenya.usecase=tinymce.edit" to your 
  address-bar URL.
  

This module has been developed and tested with TinyMCE 2.0.6.
