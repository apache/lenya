TinyMCE Editor integration for Lenya 1.4


Installation:

- Download TinyMCE from http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/ and 
  unpack the archive in the resources directory of this module.
  That should give you a subdirectory named "tinymce"
  OR
  Download TinyMCE and unpack the archive in 
  $PUB_HOME/lenya/modules/tinymce/resource/

- Optionally download additional language packs and unpack them
  in the same place. (The new files will end up in tinymce/ as 
  well.)

- Check the file permissions of the new "tinymce" directory.
  It should not be world-writable for security reasons. On UNIX systems,
  you can fix that with "chmod -R og-w tinymce/".

- Add the appropriate permissions to 
  $PUB_HOME/config/access-control/usecase-policies.xml, for example:

    <usecase id="tinymce.edit">
      <role id="admin" method="grant"/>
      <role id="edit" method="grant"/>
    </usecase>

    <usecase id="tinymce.insertImage">
      <role id="admin" method="grant"/>
      <role id="edit" method="grant"/>
    </usecase>

   This will allow the "admin" and "edit" roles to access the 
   usecases to edit and upload images.
 
- To add a menu entry, in $PUB_HOME/config/publication.xconf
  add  <module name="tinymce"/> next to the other module 
  declarations. This does not work in the default publication, 
  because it creates its own custom menus. But for a quick test,
  you can append "?lenya.usecase=tinymce.edit" to your 
  address-bar URL.
  

Make your site play well with TinyMCE:

You will find that TinyMCE does not look good with certain layout styles.
Specifically, floating objects inside your editable area will result in 
sub-optimal layout when the editor is active. To achive true WYSIWYG, try 
to design your page so that editable areas have a fixed size and no floats 
(you can still have accessible design by using "em" instead of "px").

By default, TinyMCE will parse your CSS stylesheet and make all classes
available in its styling dropdown menu. That means you should not 
introduce classes for one-shot stylings outside the editable area (unless
you want to make those stylings available in the content area as well).
Use ids instead.


This module has been developed and tested with TinyMCE 2.1.0.
