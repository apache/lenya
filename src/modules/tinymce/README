Loosely based on a module written by Wyona (http://wyona.com).
Thanks to Bob Harner, Renaud Richardet and Tim Hannigan for
documentation and code examples.

Lenya 1.4 integration and some extra bells and whistles
by JÃ¶rn Nettingsmeier <nettings@folkwang-hochschule.de>.


Installation:

- Download TinyMCE from http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/ and 
  unpack the archive in the resources directory of this module.

- Optionally download additional language packs and unpack them
  in the same place.

- To add a menu entry, in $YOURPUB/config/publication.xconf
  add  <module name="tinymce"/> next to the other module 
  declarations.

- Add the appropriate permissions to 
  $YOURPUB/config/ac/usecase-permissions.conf, for example:

    <usecase id="tinymce.edit">
      <role id="admin" method="grant"/>
      <role id="edit" method="grant"/>
    </usecase>
 
  This will allow the "admin" and "edit" roles to access the 
  usecase.


This module has been developed and tested with TinyMCE 2.0.6.
