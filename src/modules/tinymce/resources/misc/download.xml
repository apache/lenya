<page:title>TinyMCE not found</page:title>
<page:body>
  <h1>No TinyMCE installation was found on your system.</h1>
  <p>
    Due to license incompatibilites, TinyMCE (released under the GPL) cannot
    be distributed with Lenya (released under the Apache License 2.0), although
    it is perfectly legal for you to use them together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/download.php">download the 
    TinyMCE editor from moxiecode.com</a>.<br />
    Lenya's TinyMCE module is compatible with TinyMCE 3.0.x.
    Unpack the zip archive or tarball in your Lenya source tree under
    <code>$LENYA-SRC/src/modules/tinymce/resources</code>. Alternatively, you can
    install it to <code>$PUB_HOME/lenya/modules/tinymce/resources</code> 
    (if you prefer not to have external code in your Lenya source tree), 
    since all calls to this code are fallback-enabled.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, TinyMCE comes with an English localization only. If you prefer
    another language, you can 
    <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/language.php">download additional
    language catalogues</a>. Unpack them in your Lenya source tree under
    <code>$LENYA-SRC/src/modules/tinymce/resources/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce</code>,
    or <code>$PUB_HOME/lenya/modules/tinymce/resources/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce</code>,
    respectively.    
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on the setting of the "modules.copy" option in 
    <code>local.build.properties</code> you will have to rebuild Lenya before
    you can use TinyMCE.
  </p>
  <p>
    No further setup is required, but if you want to fine-tune TinyMCE, edit 
    <code>modules/tinymce/resources/javascript/tiny_config.js</code>.<br/>
    Refer to the excellent 
    <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/tinymce/docs/index.html">TinyMCE
    documentation</a> for details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to the crew at moxiecode for a capable, exceptionally clean,
    well-packaged and extensively documented open-source editor! Enjoy.
