The tinymce module uses a cocoon URI view for its usecase
(see ../config/cocoon-xconf/usecase-tinymce-edit.xconf).
Hence it does not need a usecase template.
It calls two other generic usecases, tinymce.InsertAsset 
and tinymce.InsertLink. When these are ready, they will
be moved to the editors module, since they do not contain
any tinymce-specific code and should be applicable to other
editors as well.
