      <!-- This is the view of the ac.visit usecase (see config/cocoon-xconf/usecase-ac-visit.xconf).
           It is a pseudo-usecase meant to map the PolicyAuthorizer into the realm of usecase policies, 
           i.e. the policy authorizer will ask the UsecaseAuthorizer for an authorization for the usecase
           ac.visit when a user requests a page. Then you can use the existing usecase policy editor to
           configure it.
           It is never actually invoked, and so this view does not make all that much sense.
           But since it *is* a usecase, why not make it work? -->
