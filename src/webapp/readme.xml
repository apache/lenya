    <h1>README: Apache Lenya</h1>
    <h2>Note to developers</h2>
    <p>
      Please use this new README to inform users
      about changes in the code or behaviour of Lenya. It is located under
      <code>src/webapp/readme.xml</code>. Its contents will be shown on the global 
      welcome page, and also on the introduction page of every publication.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Important notes for beta testers of Lenya 1.4-RC</h2>
    
    <h3>
      2007-07-03: <code>publication.xml/proxies</code> replaced by <code>cocoon.xconf/GlobalProxies</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;proxies&gt;</code> element in <code>publication.xml</code> is not
      supported anymore. Instead, you have to configure the <code>GlobalProxies</code>
      service entry in <code>cocoon.xconf</code>. For more information, see
      <a href="http://www.nabble.com/-1.4---Proposal--Global-proxy-configuration-tf3999411.html">[Proposal] Global proxy configuration</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      2007-06-26: <code>base-url</code> and <code>proxy-url</code> input modules
      replaced by <code>proxy</code> module
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <code>base-url</code> and <code>proxy-url</code> input modules have been replaced by the
      <code>proxy</code> module. The functionality of this module corresponds to the ProxyTransformer
      with one exception: If the <em>webappUrl</em> parameter is an empty string, the root
      proxy URL (or the context prefix, resp.) is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usage: <code>{proxy:{webappUrl}}</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-06-13: Apply ProxyTransformer after UuidToUrlTransformer</h3>
    <p>
      The uuid2url and proxy transformers now complement each other. You have
      to apply the proxy transformer right after the uuid2url transformer:
    </p>
    <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<map:transform type="uuid2url"/>
<map:transform type="proxy"/>
...]]></source>
    <p>
      Internal links (to documents, CSS, etc.) don't need to contain the context path
      anymore, this is now handled by the proxy transformer.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-05-29: Using UUID-based URLs for navigation elements</h3>
    <p>
      Now the sitetree module uses <code>lenya-document:{uuid}</code> URLs for navigation elements.
      Because no HTTP URLs are evaluated anymore, you need to pass the document's path instead
      of URL to the navigation element calls, i.e. the step <code>/{6}</code> in the following call
      has to be the document's path in the site structure: 
    </p>
    <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<map:generate src="cocoon://modules/sitetree/{1}/{2}/{3}/{4}/{5}/{6}.xml>]]></source>
    
    <h3>2007-05-25: Converted "About Lenya" page to usecase</h3>
    <p>
      To enable the "About Lenya" usecase, please set the permissions for the <code>admin.aboutLenya</code>
      usecase in your <code>config/access-control/usecase-policies.xml</code> file, or use the
      tab "Usecases" in the administration GUI.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-05-08: Fixed <code>create-use-case</code> attribute</h3>
    <p>
      The value of the <code>create-use-case</code> attribute of the <code>user-type</code>
      element in <code>access-control.xml</code> was invalid. The admin area didn't use
      this attribute yet. Since this has been fixed, you have to update your
      <code>$PUB_HOME/config/access-control/access-control.xml</code> files:
    </p>
    <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<user-type class="org.apache.lenya.ac.file.FileUser"
    create-use-case="admin.addUser">Local User</user-type>]]></source>
    
    <h3>2007-05-05: Introduced <code>workflow.multiWorkflowInvoke</code> usecase</h3>
    <p>
      Please add the permissions for this usecase to your
      <code>config/access-control/usecase-policies.xml</code> file, or use the
      tab "Usecases" in the administration GUI.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-30: Renamed
      <code>$PUB_HOME/config/publication.xconf</code> to <code>publication.xml</code></h3>
    
    <p>
      Please rename your <code>$PUB_HOME/config/publication.xconf</code> file to
      <code>$PUB_HOME/config/publication.xml</code>.
      This change was done to preserve consistency with the other configuration file names.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-23: Moved and renamed
    <code>$PUB_HOME/config/lucene_index.xconf</code></h3>
    
    <p>
      Please move and rename your <code>$PUB_HOME/config/lucene_index.xconf</code> file to
      <code>$PUB_HOME/config/search/lucene_index.xml</code>.
      This change was done to preserve consistency with the other configuration file names and locations.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-23: Moved <code>$MODULE_HOME/module.xml</code></h3>
    
    <p>
      If you are using custom modules, please move your <code>module.xml</code> file into the
      <code>config/</code> directory of the module (create one if necessary).
      This change was done to preserve consistency with the <code>publication.xml</code> location.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-18: <code>ac/</code> is now <code>access-control/</code></h3>
    <p>
      In order to make the Lenya publication configuration more
      self-explanatory, the directory <code>$PUB_HOME/config/ac</code> has
      been renamed to <code>$PUB_HOME/config/access-control</code>.
      Additionally, the access control configuration file has been renamed
      from <code>ac.xconf</code> to <code>access-control.xml</code>.<br />
      You will have to change your custom publications accordingly. Don't
      forget to change the path settings in <code>access-control.xml</code> as well!
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note the new suffix! From now on, "xconf" will only be used for patchfiles
      that are integrated into cocoon.xconf at build time. All other
      configuration files that are parsed directly should end in .xml.</em>
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-13: You need to update your custom <code>publication.xconf</code> files!</h3>
    <p>
      As of revision 528490, the file <code>$PUB_HOME/publication.xml</code>
      is no longer used. Its contents should be merged into <code>$PUB_HOME/config/publication.xconf.</code>
      To accomodate this, the format of <code>publication.xconf</code> has changed a bit (see
      below).<br />
      Sorry for the breakage, but we were able to eliminate a lot of old ad-hoc code
      and duplication with this change, and the new xconf file looks a lot nicer and more intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Most important changes:</em> All elements in <code>publication.xconf</code> 
      must now be in the namespace <code>http://apache.org/cocoon/lenya/publication/1.1</code>,
      and <code>&lt;module/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;proxy/&gt;</code>, and 
      <code>&lt;resource-type&gt;</code> elements must now be grouped 
      in <code>&lt;modules/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;proxies/&gt;</code>, 
      and <code>&lt;resource-types/&gt;</code>. See the default publication
      for an example.<br />
      You can use the RNG schema at <code>src/resources/build/publication.rng</code>
      to verify that your file is correct:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        cd $LENYA_HOME<br />
        java -jar lib/jing-20030619.jar \<br />
        &#160;&#160;src/resources/build/publication.rng \<br />
        &#160;&#160;$YOURPUB/config/publication.xconf
      </code>
    </p>
    <h3>New per-publication <code>readme.xml</code></h3>
    <p>
      If you want to provide a custom README for your publication (maybe you
      have used the old &lt;lenya:readme/&gt; in the now gone
      publication.xconf), you can put it in <code>$YOURPUB/readme.xml</code>. 
      It is now a standard Lenya CMS page in the
      <code>http://apache.org/cocoon/lenya/cms-page/1.0</code> namespace.
