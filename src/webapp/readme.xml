    <h1>README: Apache Lenya</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Note to developers:</em> Please use this file to inform users
      about changes in the code or behaviour of Lenya. It is located under
      <code>src/webapp/readme.xml</code>. Its contents will be shown on the global 
      welcome page, and also on the introduction page of every publication.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>You need to update your custom publication.xconf files!</em></strong></p>
    <p>
      As of revision FIXME, the file <code>$YOURPUB/publication.xml</code>
      is deprecated and no longer used. Its contents should be moved to
      <code>$YOURPUB/config/publication.xconf.</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Most important changes:</em> All elements in publication.xconf must now be
      in the namespace <code>http://apache.org/cocoon/lenya/publication/1.1</code>,
      and <code>&lt;module/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;proxy/&gt;</code>, and 
      <code>&lt;resource-type&gt;</code> elements must now be grouped 
      in <code>&lt;modules/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;proxies/&gt;</code>, 
      and <code>&lt;resource-types&gt;</code>. See the default publication
      for an example.<br />
      You can use <code>webapp/lenya/resources/schemas/publication.rng</code>
      to verify that your file is correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to provide a custom README for your publication, you can
      put it in <code>$YOURPUP/readme.xsl</code>. 
      Just copy this file over and modify to your needs.
