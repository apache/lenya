    <h1>README: Apache Lenya</h1>
    <h2>Note to developers</h2>
    <p>
      Please use this new README to inform users
      about changes in the code or behaviour of Lenya. It is located under
      <code>src/webapp/readme.xml</code>. Its contents will be shown on the global 
      welcome page, and also on the introduction page of every publication.
    </p>
    <h2>Important notes for beta testers of Lenya 1.4</h2>
    <h3>2007-04-18: <code>ac/</code> is now <code>access-control/</code></h3>
    <p>
      In order to make the Lenya publication configuration more
      self-explanatory, the directory <code>$YOURPUB/config/ac</code> has
      been renamed to <code>$YOURPUB/config/access-control</code>. You will
      have to change your custom publications accordingly.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-13: You need to update your custom publication.xconf files!</h3>
    <p>
      As of revision FIXME, the file <code>$YOURPUB/publication.xml</code>
      is no longer used. Its contents should be moved to <code>$YOURPUB/config/publication.xconf.</code>
      To accomodate this, the format of <code>publication.xconf</code> has changed a bit (see
      below).<br />
      Sorry for the breakage, but we were able to eliminate a lot of old ad-hoc code
      and duplication with this change, and the new xconf file looks a lot nicer and more intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Most important changes:</em> All elements in <code>publication.xconf</code> 
      must now be in the namespace <code>http://apache.org/cocoon/lenya/publication/1.1</code>,
      and <code>&lt;module/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;proxy/&gt;</code>, and 
      <code>&lt;resource-type&gt;</code> elements must now be grouped 
      in <code>&lt;modules/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;proxies/&gt;</code>, 
      and <code>&lt;resource-types/&gt;</code>. See the default publication
      for an example.<br />
      You can use the RNG schema at <code>webapp/lenya/resources/schemas/publication.rng</code>
      to verify that your file is correct:
      <blockquote>
        <code>
          cd $LENYA_HOME<br />
          java -jar lib/jing-20030619.jar src/webapp/lenya/resources/schemas/publication.rng $YOURPUB/config/publication.xconf
        </code>
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <h2>New per-publication <code>readme.xml</code></h2>
    <p>
      If you want to provide a custom README for your publication (maybe you
      have used the old &lt;lenya:readme/&gt; in the now gone
      publication.xml), you can put it in <code>$YOURPUB/readme.xml</code>. 
      It is now a standard Lenya CMS page in the
      <code>http://apache.org/cocoon/lenya/cms-page/1.0</code> namespace.
