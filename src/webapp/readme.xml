    <h2>Important notes for users updating from an earlier 2.0 release</h2>

    <h3>2009-09-13: I18n catalogues require proper namespace</h3>
    <p>
      Ever since some update in late 2008, all your custom I18n catalogues
      <strong>must</strong> be in the namespace
      <em>xmlns="http://apache.org/cocoon/i18n/2.1"</em>, otherwise
      localization transformation will break globally when you migrate to a recent
      version.<br/>
      Symptoms are "untranslated" buttons and message keys displayed in
      place of the actual translation.<br />
      Thanks to user Gerd for
      <a href="http://marc.info/?l=lenya-dev&amp;m=122558896606926&amp;w=2">finding this out</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>2007-11-08: Redirection changes</h3>
    <p>
      Most of our sitemap redirects have been changed to make them work with
      proxy environments. If you notice any regressions, please complain to
      the dev list immediately.
    </p>
    <h3>2007-11-08: New Proxy test scaffold</h3>
    <p>
      If you are a developer or a user interested in proxying, please take a
      look at the proxy test scaffold in tools/proxytest and read the
      README. It's important to regularly test new code in proxied
      environments and non-root contexts.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-08-22: User names are now case insensitive</h3>
    <p>
      User names are now case insensitive to better support Windows, user assumptions, auto form 
      completion, and support. This is done by converting all user names to lower case. Any
      previously created accounts with upper case characters will no longer work. To fix
      delete and recreate the account using the built in tools. Or optionally, rename any
      *.iml files in your publication's <code>config/access-control/passwd</code> directory
      so that the file names are all lower case. You will also have to edit the <code>id</code> 
      attribute of the <code>identity</code> element to make it lower case in those files as well.
    </p>

    <h3>2007-08-13: Workflow schema validation fixed</h3>
    <p>
      The old XSD-based schema validation in <code>workflow.xml</code> was
    never used. It has now been ported to RNG for consistency and is applied to your custom
      workflows during deployment. You will need to remove the
    <code>xsi:schemaLocation</code> attribute (and you can then also remove
      the <code>xmlns:xsi</code> declaration) from your custom publications'
      <code>config/workflow/workflow.xml</code> if you have defined one.
    </p>    
    
    <h3>2007-08-12: Resource type configuration changed</h3>
    <p>
      The configuration syntax of resource types has been changed for consistency. 
      Please apply the following changes to your custom resource type configurations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;sample-name mime-type="baz" name="bar"&gt;fallback://foo&lt;/sample-name&gt;</code>
        becomes
        <code>&lt;sample mime-type="baz" name="bar" uri="fallback://foo"/&gt;</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;schema src="fallback://foo.rng" language="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/0.9"/&gt;</code>
        becomes
        <code>&lt;schema uri="fallback://foo.rng" namespace="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/0.9"/&gt;</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After that, you need to delete
    <code>build/lenya/webapp/WEB-INF/cocoon.xconf</code> and rebuild Lenya
      to deploy the changes.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-07-27: PolicyAuthorizer removed</h3>
    <p>
      The access control for Lenya documents is now also handled by the
    UsecaseAuthorizer via a newly introduced usecase "ac.visit". For your
      custom publications, you will need to give your users the appropriate
    permissions. We suggest copying the <code>visit.rml</code> role from the default
      publication.<br />
      Moreover, be sure to remove the <code>&lt;authorizer
      type="policy"/&gt;</code> line from your publications'
    <code>config/access-control/access-control.xml</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>2007-07-27: new generic editor usecases</h3>
    <p>
      A new generic set of editor helper usecases has been introduced:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>editors.insertLink</li>
      <li>editors.insertImage</li>
      <li>editors.insertAsset</li>
      <li>editors.createResource</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are now re-used by all editors, which got us rid of a lot of
      code duplication. Internet Explorer users watch out: if you have
      problems with selections not working properly when using those new
      usecases, please complain on the dev list.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-07-19: <code>mime-type</code> attribute for resource type samples</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;sample-name&gt;</code> elements of the resource type declaration
      must have a <code>mime-type</code> attribute. This allows the Create usecase to initialize
      the MIME type of the document correctly.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-07-12: <code>publication.xml/proxies</code> wrapper element re-introduced</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;proxies&gt;</code> wrapper element is now required again for consistency reasons.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      2007-07-03: <code>publication.xml/proxies</code> replaced by <code>cocoon.xconf/GlobalProxies</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;proxies&gt;</code> element in <code>publication.xml</code> is not
      supported anymore. Instead, you have to configure the <code>GlobalProxies</code>
      service entry in <code>cocoon.xconf</code>. For more information, see
      <a href="http://www.nabble.com/-1.4---Proposal--Global-proxy-configuration-tf3999411.html">[Proposal] Global proxy configuration</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      2007-06-26: <code>base-url</code> and <code>proxy-url</code> input modules
      replaced by <code>proxy</code> module
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <code>base-url</code> and <code>proxy-url</code> input modules have been replaced by the
      <code>proxy</code> module. The functionality of this module corresponds to the ProxyTransformer
      with one exception: If the <em>webappUrl</em> parameter is an empty string, the root
      proxy URL (or the context prefix, resp.) is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usage: <code>{proxy:{webappUrl}}</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-06-13: Apply ProxyTransformer after UuidToUrlTransformer</h3>
    <p>
      The uuid2url and proxy transformers now complement each other. You have
      to apply the proxy transformer right after the uuid2url transformer:
    </p>
    <p><code><![CDATA[<map:transform type="uuid2url"/>
<map:transform type="proxy"/>
...]]></code></p>
    <p>
      Internal links (to documents, CSS, etc.) don't need to contain the context path
      anymore, this is now handled by the proxy transformer.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-05-29: Using UUID-based URLs for navigation elements</h3>
    <p>
      Now the sitetree module uses <code>lenya-document:{uuid}</code> URLs for navigation elements.
      Because no HTTP URLs are evaluated anymore, you need to pass the document's path instead
      of URL to the navigation element calls, i.e. the step <code>/{6}</code> in the following call
      has to be the document's path in the site structure: 
    </p>
    <p><code><![CDATA[<map:generate src="cocoon://modules/sitetree/{1}/{2}/{3}/{4}/{5}/{6}.xml>]]></code></p>
    
    <h3>2007-05-25: Converted "About Lenya" page to usecase</h3>
    <p>
      To enable the "About Lenya" usecase, please set the permissions for the <code>admin.aboutLenya</code>
      usecase in your <code>config/access-control/usecase-policies.xml</code> file, or use the
      tab "Usecases" in the administration GUI.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-05-08: Fixed <code>create-use-case</code> attribute</h3>
    <p>
      The value of the <code>create-use-case</code> attribute of the <code>user-type</code>
      element in <code>access-control.xml</code> was invalid. The admin area didn't use
      this attribute yet. Since this has been fixed, you have to update your
      <code>$PUB_HOME/config/access-control/access-control.xml</code> files:
    </p>
    <p><code><![CDATA[<user-type class="org.apache.lenya.ac.file.FileUser"
    create-use-case="admin.addUser">Local User</user-type>]]></code></p>
    
    <h3>2007-05-05: Introduced <code>workflow.multiWorkflowInvoke</code> usecase</h3>
    <p>
      Please add the permissions for this usecase to your
      <code>config/access-control/usecase-policies.xml</code> file, or use the
      tab "Usecases" in the administration GUI.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-30: Renamed
      <code>$PUB_HOME/config/publication.xconf</code> to <code>publication.xml</code></h3>
    
    <p>
      Please rename your <code>$PUB_HOME/config/publication.xconf</code> file to
      <code>$PUB_HOME/config/publication.xml</code>.
      This change was done to preserve consistency with the other configuration file names.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-23: Moved and renamed
    <code>$PUB_HOME/config/lucene_index.xconf</code></h3>
    
    <p>
      Please move and rename your <code>$PUB_HOME/config/lucene_index.xconf</code> file to
      <code>$PUB_HOME/config/search/lucene_index.xml</code>.
      This change was done to preserve consistency with the other configuration file names and locations.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-23: Moved <code>$MODULE_HOME/module.xml</code></h3>
    
    <p>
      If you are using custom modules, please move your <code>module.xml</code> file into the
      <code>config/</code> directory of the module (create one if necessary).
      This change was done to preserve consistency with the <code>publication.xml</code> location.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-18: <code>ac/</code> is now <code>access-control/</code></h3>
    <p>
      In order to make the Lenya publication configuration more
      self-explanatory, the directory <code>$PUB_HOME/config/ac</code> has
      been renamed to <code>$PUB_HOME/config/access-control</code>.
      Additionally, the access control configuration file has been renamed
      from <code>ac.xconf</code> to <code>access-control.xml</code>.<br />
      You will have to change your custom publications accordingly. Don't
      forget to change the path settings in <code>access-control.xml</code> as well!
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note the new suffix! From now on, "xconf" will only be used for patchfiles
      that are integrated into cocoon.xconf at build time. All other
      configuration files that are parsed directly should end in .xml.</em>
    </p>
    
    <h3>2007-04-13: You need to update your custom <code>publication.xconf</code> files!</h3>
    <p>
      As of revision 528490, the file <code>$PUB_HOME/publication.xml</code>
      is no longer used. Its contents should be merged into <code>$PUB_HOME/config/publication.xconf.</code>
      To accomodate this, the format of <code>publication.xconf</code> has changed a bit (see
      below).<br />
      Sorry for the breakage, but we were able to eliminate a lot of old ad-hoc code
      and duplication with this change, and the new xconf file looks a lot nicer and more intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Most important changes:</em> All elements in <code>publication.xconf</code> 
      must now be in the namespace <code>http://apache.org/cocoon/lenya/publication/1.1</code>,
      and <code>&lt;module/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;proxy/&gt;</code>, and 
      <code>&lt;resource-type&gt;</code> elements must now be grouped 
      in <code>&lt;modules/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;proxies/&gt;</code>, 
      and <code>&lt;resource-types/&gt;</code>. See the default publication
      for an example.<br />
      You can use the RNG schema at <code>src/resources/build/publication.rng</code>
      to verify that your file is correct:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        cd $LENYA_HOME<br />
        java -jar lib/jing-20030619.jar \<br />
        &#160;&#160;src/resources/build/publication.rng \<br />
        &#160;&#160;$YOURPUB/config/publication.xconf
      </code>
    </p>
    <h3>New per-publication <code>readme.xml</code></h3>
    <p>
      If you want to provide a custom README for your publication (maybe you
      have used the old &lt;lenya:readme/&gt; in the now gone
      publication.xconf), you can put it in <code>$YOURPUB/readme.xml</code>. 
      It is now a standard Lenya CMS page in the
      <code>http://apache.org/cocoon/lenya/cms-page/1.0</code> namespace.
