    <h2>About Apache Lenya</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://lenya.apache.org">Apache Lenya</a> is a Java-based 
      <a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open-Source</a> Content Management System. 
      It is based on open standards such as <a href="http://www.w3c.org/XML/">XML</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a>. One of its core components is 
      <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</a> from the 
      <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenya supports inline WYSIWYG editors such as <a href="http://kupu.oscom.org">Kupu</a> 
      or <a href="http://bxe.oscom.org">BXE</a>. Your site editors do not have to learn XML.
      This is possible thanks to the support of XML, XSLT and XML Schema on the client side.
      An administration interface allows advanced users to monitor the CMS, and perform 
      configuration tasks.
    </p>
