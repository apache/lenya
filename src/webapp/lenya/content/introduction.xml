<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>
Apache Lenya is the refactored version of XPS (Extensible Publishing System).
XPS is being used by Switzerland's most famous newspaper Neue Z&#252;rcher Zeitung
for their interactive edition <a href="http://www.nzz.ch">NZZ Online</a>. The system
is being used 7 days a week and 24 hours a day by editors and automatic processes (i.e. nightly
generation of the online version from the print edition). It is up and running since October 2, 2000.
XPS was Open Source from the beginning (Apache license).</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Apache Lenya is a Java-based <a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open-Source</a>
Content Management System. It
is based on open standards such as <a href="http://www.w3c.org/XML/">XML</a> and <a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a>. One of its core
components is <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</a> from the
<a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
</p>
		
<p>
Lenya supports inline WYSIWYG editing. Your site editors do
not have to learn XML. This is possible thanks to the support
of XML, XSLT and XML Schema on the client side.
An adminstration interface allows advanced users to
monitor the CMS, and perform configuration tasks.
