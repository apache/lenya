<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>
Wyona CMS is the refactored version of XPS (Extensible Publishing System).
XPS is currently used by Switzerland's most famous newspaper Neue Z&#252;rcher Zeitung
for their interactive edition <a href="http://www.nzz.ch">NZZ Online</a>. The system
is being used 7 days a week and 24 hours a day by editors and automatic processes (i.e. nightly
generation of the online version of the print edition). It is up and running since October 2, 2000.
XPS was Open Source from the beginning (Apache license). Concerning the know-how within the system, it
should have become a killer CMS (at least for newspapers), but we made two crucial mistakes: Bad Documentation and a bad installer. We hopefully do a better job this time.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Wyona CMS is an <a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open-Source</a>
Content Management and Publishing System written in 100% pure Java. It
is based on open standards such as <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/XML/">XML</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a>. One of its core
components is the pipeline processor <a
href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">Cocoon</a> from the <a
href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Wyona is actually just an interpreter of various XMLs, not just
user's data, such as for instance articles, press-releases or addresses,
but also regarding functionalities, such as for instance
access controlling (IML and PML resp. <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xacml/">XACML</a>), revision controlling (RCML)
or workflow management (WFML). The concept is similar to the one of a
"HTML Browser". You should be able to switch the Content Management System
at any time. The network is the CMS.
</p>

<p>
Wyona supports inline WYSIWYG editing, which means users (editors) do
not have to learn (or see) XML. This is possible thanks to the support
of XML, XSLT and XML Schema on the client side, such is the case
for certain browsers (Netscape 6.2 or IE 5.5).
But there also exists the "Wyona Administrator" for the more
advanced user, where the CMS can be monitored, XML can be edited
directly or authentication and authorization can be managed.
