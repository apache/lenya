"""kupu interfaces for Zope3

kupu for Zope3 consist of a an IHTMLBody field and a widget (browser
view) to a zope.schema field that we call HTMLBody (since it contains
the contents of an HTML body). As a widget, it can make no assumptions
whatsoever on the object that its field is being part of. It can only
make assumptions on the field itself.

We therefore also define the IKupuAsynchronousCapable, a marker
interface that can be set on content objects (even on an object per
object basis) and tells the Zope3 view machiner that our special Kupu
views, the ones that make asynchronous editing possible, apply.
