====================
Contributing to kupu
====================

Who can contribute?
-------------------

Anyone. If possible, you will be given appropriate credit in the
CREDITS.txt file. In case we should not mention you, please write us an
email.

How can I contribute?
---------------------

For small contributions, please send an email with a UNIX patchfile
attached to kupu-development@lists.sourceforge.net. Make sure you say
what version the patch applies to, what it changes and why this was
necessary.

Alternatively, you can submit bug reports and/or patches to the issue
tracker: http://codespeak.net/issues/kupu/ (mind the trailing slash).

If you have written a target-platform customization layer for kupu and
would like us to include it in the main distribution, please send a
detailed email to kupu-development@lists.sourceforge.net. Depending
on our decision whether to include it or not, you will receive CVS
checkin rights. You will then also be responsible for maintaining this
customization layer.

What are the rules?
-------------------

1. Contributions must only only contain code written by you. You may
not contribute code copyrighted by anyone else. You will be held
responsible if you violate this rule.

2. By contributing, you agree that the code contributed by you will be
published in the kupu distribution under the Kupu License. See
LICENSE.txt for license text.

3. Code in the kupu/common layer may not contain any platform specific
code, neither the ZPT macros nor the JavaScript. The unwritten law is:
The common layer shall be viewable in a web browser directly off of
the filesystem.
