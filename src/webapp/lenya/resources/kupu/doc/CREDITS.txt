kupu credits
============

* Paul Everitt

  - leadership and guidance in Kupu development

  - JavaScript God

  - made the original proposal to refactor Epoz using Page Template
    macros and CSS styles.

  - much of the initial hacking, conversion to OO, async saving etc.

* Philipp von Weitershausen

  - Came up with the directory structure that lets Kupu be both a
    Zope2, CMF, and Plone product as well as a Zope3 package.

  - Invented and implemented XML/XSLT based templating system.

  - Implemented library drawers with help from Paul and Guido.

  - Zope2, CMF, Plone 2 and Zope3 integration

  - Administrative tasks, thanks again Philipp...

* Guido Wesdorp

  - Mr. Kupu :)

  - Maintainer, bugfixer and feature adder

  - Came up with the idea to make Kupu server-independent (runs on
    'plain' webservers such as Apache now)

  - Came up with the idea for the cleanup functionality that uses
    browser's DOM functionality to get well-formed XML out of Kupu

  - Improved table support, link support, etc.

  - Refactored the kupu editor to MVC-like components, making it much
    more flexible for customization.

  - Silva integration (most of that is in Silva itself, though)

  - Many, many features, such as context menus, stateful buttons, DOM
    inspector, unit tests.

* Duncan Booth

  - Wrote (more) advanced ContentFilter system, zoom mode and did a lot of
    Plone work.
