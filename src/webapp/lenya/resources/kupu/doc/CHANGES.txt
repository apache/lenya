============
Kupu changes
============

- Post 1.2.1

  - Fixed problem in Silva (although the problem exists in other setups too,
    I fixed it only for Silva, since it requires server-side logic too) with
    IE, that generated absolute paths for user-entered relative ones (and 
    failing miserably at it because of Zope/Silva's extraordinary URL
    behaviour).

  - Tidied up zoom mode. Added kupu-fulleditor-zoomed class to body
    when zoomed so you can use css to hide other controls on page (IE
    ignores z-index on SELECT boxes).

  - Further adjustment for issue 70 to give slightly prettier
    formatting.

- 1.2.1

  - Fixed some context bugs with External Sources (Silva specific), now Kupu
    uses the same functionality to find code sources as the rest of Silva
    does.

  The following issue has been resolved:

  - 70: Content duplication (when pasting into IE from Microsoft Word or Works).

- 1.2 final

  - Linking to the current folder produced an empty link. Now it links to "."
  - Changed how kupu in Plone handles non-HTML content e.g. STX. Now it won't
    load for fields in Archetypes content if the content type isn't HTML (but 
    it does put in a link allowing you to force a conversion). See
    http://plone.org/collector/3900

- 1.2rc2

  - Fixed getSelectedNode, this should now behave correctly even in edge 
    situations and when there's no selection.
  - Added support for linking to folderish content with the link drawer.
  - Fixed JS error when clicking on a Control selection.
  - Changed Plone table style to use 3d borders.
  - Added Silva support for 1.2, including some new Silva-specific tools.
  - Zoom button is now available in the default template.
  - Creating links was broken by the fixes to #146, rewrote link
    creation to be more robust and predictable.
  - Changed 'halign' as the attribute to set the alignment of tables
    and tablecells to 'align'.

  Apache Lenya enhancements:
  
  * improved handling of image assets
  * enabled roundtrip of image editing between Kupu and BXE
    (http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29164)
  * fixed bug that inserted multiple meta charset entries per save.
  * slight wording changes here and there
  * strip out XHTML attributes that are not XHTML strict upon save, and
    convert b to strong, and i to em.
  
- Kupu 1.2rc1

  The following issues have been resolved (see the `issue tracker`_
  for details of the numbered ones):

  - 153: Exit from bulleted list: next paragraph becomes a list item
  - 152: Install.py does not work with CMF
  - 151: This function requires better XML support in your browser
  - 150: Javscript error in IE when viewing empty html source and style select 
    changed
  - 149: When using Zoom on Plone site, the right portlets are not disabled
  - 146: kupu 1.2b tagName is null or not an object javascript error in IE
  - 143: Invalid request error when trying to edit raw HTML using Safari
  - 141: Inserting links in Gecko browsers sometimes replaced the selected
    text with the link title.
  - 94: Using kupu with Plone via SSL gives error on IE
    (this was already marked as resolved but had recurred).
  - Fixed 'phantom whitespace' problem. Saved format was 'text/html'
    which non-AT content types interpret as an alias for 'stx'. Now
    sets format to 'html' for non-AT content types.
  - Opening a drawer gave error 404 on Plone systems when Archetypes 
    was not installed.


.. _`issue tracker`: http://codespeak.net/issues/kupu/

- Kupu 1.2 beta 1

  * Added image upload.

  * Added support for CSS 'float' for images.

  * Fixed some documentation that said Netscape 7.0 was supported, which
    it never was, the minimal Netscape version required to use Kupu has
    always been 7.1

  * Fixed problem where empty title tags broke rendering on IE after a save.

  * Configurable filtering with whitelists and blacklists which
    significantly speeds up save time on IE.

  * Zoom mode to make Kupu fill the browser window.

  * BeforeUnload handler added which controls all form fields.

  * Plone enhancements:

    - Drawer support now fully integrated.
    - Customisation by control panel or Python script.
    - Paragraph styles may be defined globally or for Archetypes
      fields.
    - Links to Archetypes objects done by UID.
    - Optionally Archetypes can store references for links created by
      Kupu.
    - Optional output transform to hide UIDs and add captions to
      images.
    - Kupu and Epoz can now coexist on the same Plone site.

- Kupu 1.1

  * Re-added experimental dist with inspector.

  * Moved drawers to the experimental dist.

  * Some fixes in the Citation tool and External Source tools

  * Fixed bug that made Kupu break on certain type of meta-tags in the
    editable document.

  * Moved definition list tool to the main and form dist.

  * Made Damian Gajda's SourceEditTool replace the switchSourceEdit function.

- Kupu 1.1 beta 2 (2004-05-27)

  * Added source editing for Silva.

  * Fixed the Image tool in Silva: URL's are now editable and will be made
    relative if at all possible.

  * Fixed some small bugs for Silva.

  * Assured proper hiding of RemoveElementButtons in IE.

  * Updated unit tests to reflect new ECMAUnit API

- Kupu 1.1 beta 1 (2004-05-21)

  * Added Selection object that provides a cross-browser API for working
    with the document's selection and cursor. This can be used to e.g. add
    and manipulate arbitrary elements (it's used for instance in Silva's 
    definition lists code).

  * Templates for different systems are now generated with an
    XML/XSLT-based templating system.

  * Added state for buttons, if one is inside a tag controlled by a button
    the button gets a new class (this way when inside e.g. a bold tag the
    bold button can look pressed).

  * Added access key functionality.

  * Implemented a new way of inserting images and linking to
    documents, library drawers. Drawers are windows that open up
    inside the browser without invoking a browser popup. Library
    drawers load information about linkable/insertable objects from
    the server via standardized XML.

  * Some core functionality is now covered by unit tests, based on the
    JavaScript testing framework ECMAUnit.

  * Fixed bug in preserving selection in IE.

  * Added double-click catching, now double-clicking stuff results in correct
    behaviour.

  * Added a few useful helpers, such as a strip() method to String objects.

- 1.0.3 (2004-03-25)

  * Renamed epoz to kupu to end the name confusion with Maik
    Jablonski's editor once and for all. Thanks to Eric Casteleijn for
    the name suggestion.

  * Kupu is distributed under the BSD-style Kupu license. See
    LICENSE.txt for license text.

  * Kupu is an official OSCOM project now. Its new homepage is
    available at http://kupu.oscom.org. The development home remains
    with Codespeak.

  * Improved preliminary Plone support. Thanks to Duncan G. Booth for
    this work.

  * Fixed bug that made IE throw an exception on re-selecting text in
    a removed element.

  * Removed the 'locales' directory for the time being. We will
    support i18n in the future, but not in this Zope-specific way.

- 1.0.2 (2004-03-06)

  * Added POST support

  * Finally added some more documentation, made some older docs less 
    Zope specific

  * Added toolboxes, a plugin for tools, to seperate functionality from
    view dependencies (this means a change in initEpoz, so custom versions
    need to be updated!)

  * Chopped epozeditor.js into several pieces (this means all existing
    installations need to be updated!)

  * Table editing in IE 5.5 is fixed, the tables don't end up
    in the parent document anymore

  * Fixed some subtle bug that caused the parent element of the
    selection to be the selected element instead of the element
    itself when a selection spanned a full element (thanks Igor
    Stroh for the IE fix!)

  * Cleaned up the HTML files and pagetemplates, there's now only 1 piece
    of JavaScript for initialization.

  * Added experimental context menu

  * Added experimental inspector tool

  * A lot of small bugfixes...

- 1.0.1 (2003-12-10)
  
  * Fixed bug that caused saving to fail in Mozilla 1.3.1

  * Fixed bug that prevented Zope from booting when Epoz and Plone were
    installed on the same instance

  * Added an example pagetemplate for Zope 2 integration

- 1.0 final (2003-11-21)

  * Fixed text style support for IE

  * Renamed epoztoolbar macro to epoz_toolbar for consistency

  * Added style sheet and headers to prevent caching in the
    example document fulldoc.html

- 1.0 beta 1 (2003-11-14)

  * Some API cleanups done

  * Added some code to 'disable' the editor during init and save
    [Issue 11]

  * Added Silva-specific JavaScript, also as an example for large
    customizations

  * Fixed major problem with IE that removed the selection from the
    iframe as soon as some other element got clicked (resulting in
    actions to be performed on the wrong location). [issue 31]

  * Fixed colorchooser in IE, also fixed background color support.

- 1.0 alpha 2 (2003-11-07)

  * Refactored epozeditor.js to a MVC-style component architecture.
    [Issue 26]

  * Added a path tool [Issue 24]

  * Added epoz logo

- 1.0 alpha 1 (2003-10-24)

  * Fix useCSS (generates a Midas error)

  * When in a list, a style picker will appear for the shape of the
    list symbols.

  *  Dumb down the link and image toolboxes

  * Let the iframe src work from Apache via a tal:attributes to
    replace the src with nothing when served from Zope

  * Added new attributes on <iframe> to configure the Epoz instance:

    - dst specifices the URL to PUT to.
  
    - usecss is either 0 or 1, to tell Midas whether to use CSS or
      element styles like <b>.

    - reloadsrc is either 0 or 1, to tell Epoz whether the server
      wants the editor to reload the source after saving.  This is
      true in Silva, which transforms the XHTML after saving.

  * Improved error message that appears if an async save fails.

  * Added plain Zope2 integration (philikon)

  * Added functionality for editing tables (adding and deleting
    rows and columns, setting alignment etc.)

  * Fixed bug in link code, the url is now added to the link 
    correctly and can also be modified

  * Replaced some timeout code with a poll loop, which should work
    better in extreme situations (slow setup, large documents etc.)

  * When the cursor is in a list, a drop-down appears to set the style
    of the list symbols (e.g. disc for ul, roman numerals for ol)
