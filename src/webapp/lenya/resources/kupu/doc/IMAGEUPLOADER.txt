===============================
Local image upload enhancement
===============================

This document gives an overview of the enhancement and describes how
to add support for other back-end servers or CMSes.

Overview
---------

Usage of the enhancement should be practically self-evident. Use the
image drawer to navigate to the folder/directory you want to upload
the image to, click "upload", which opens up an upload form, select an
image from your computer, enter a title for it, and click "insert".


Installation
-------------

By default, the enhancement is disabled. This is because initially,
there is only back-end server / CMS support for plone. Once we get
support for a few other backends, the enhancement will be enabled by
default.

To enable the enhancement include a tag `<uploadbutton>` in the xml
for the folder. See plone/kupu_plone_layer/kupucollection.xml.pt for
an example.

Technical notes
----------------

The image uploader adds new code to the following files:

 * common/kupudrawers.js

 * common/kupudrawerstyles.css
 
 * common/kupudrawers/drawer.xsl


It adds the following:

 * this file

 * plone/kupu_plone_layer/kupuUploadImage.py

 * plone/kupu_plone_layer/kupuUploadImage.py.metadata


See kupuUploadImage.py on how to add support for uploading images to
another server/CMS.


Bugs, caveats et cetera
------------------------

* After image upload, the library/collection of images does not get
  reloaded if you're using a Mozilla browser, such as FireFox. In order
  for the uploaded image(s) to be listed in the image drawer, save your
  changes and reload kupu (ie. "edit" the document again by clicking the
  "edit" tab on plone.

* Because of the above problem, there's an extra "reload current"
  button to manually refresh the image drawer contents
