TODO for Plone
==============

Make the toolbar customisable from Plone control panel, possibly by
making the kupu tool into an action provider.
[DB: I'm not sure this will work as I think the information we need is

TODO for drawers
================

These are probably core issues rather than specifically Plone.

- image drawer should go straight to the correct location when opened
  on an existing image (is this even possible?) so you can adjust
  alignment, captioning etc. without having to reinsert the image.

- add toolbox drawer to run macros which aren't deemed important
  enough to be directly on the toolbar.

- Uploading an image doesn't let you float the image. Perhaps the
  upload handler should simply refresh the drawer with the uploaded
  file selected, then you can set all the usual image options on an
  uploaded image.

IE problems and fixes
=====================

o importNode(node) fails on XML Document nodes. Use
  node.cloneNode(true) as a hack.

o drawer changes height when navigating with IE. Fixed by forcing the
  entire drawer to refresh in IE, but there must be something simpler we
  could do to have the same effect.
