<page:title>It seems that Xopus is not installed on your server</page:title>
<page:body>
<div class="lenya-box">
Lenya is expecting an <em>@XOPUS@</em> directory within your <em>webapps/ROOT</em> directory, whereas <em>@XOPUS@</em> is being configured within <em>build.properties</em> (xopus.context). Also don't forget to patch the files within the <em>xopusPlugins</em> directory (<em>cmsdriver.js</em>, etc.).
<br />
<br />
Xopus is not Open Source, but you can buy it at <a href="http://www.xopus.com">http://www.xopus.com</a>.
