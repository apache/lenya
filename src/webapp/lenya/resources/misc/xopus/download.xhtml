<page:title>It seems that Xopus is not installed on your server</page:title>
<page:body>
<div class="lenya-box">
Lenya is expecting an <i>@XOPUS@</i> directory within your <i>webapps/ROOT</i> directory, whereas <i>@XOPUS@</i> is being configured within <i>build.properties</i> (xopus.context). Also don't forget to patch the files within the <i>xopusPlugins</i> directory (<i>cmsdriver.js</i>, etc.).
<br />
<br />
Xopus is not Open Source, but you can buy it at <a href="http://www.xopus.com">http://www.xopus.com</a>.
