<page:title>It seems that Xopus is not installed on your server</page:title>
<page:body>
<div class="lenya-box">
Lenya is expecting an <em>@XOPUS:CONTEXT@</em> (e.g. Xopus-2.1.66) directory 
within your <em>@XOPUS:PATH@</em> (e.g. <em>webapps/ROOT</em>) directory. 
<em>@XOPUS:CONTEXT@</em> and <em>@XOPUS:PATH@</em> are configured 
within your <em>local.build.properties</em> (xopus.context resp. xopus.path). 
The path is relative to <em>usecase.xmap</em>. 
Also don't forget to patch the files within the 
<em>xopusPlugins</em> directory (<em>cmsdriver.js</em>, etc.) 
according to the Apache Lenya documentation.
<br />
<br />
Xopus is not Open Source, but you can buy it at <a href="http://www.xopus.com">http://www.xopus.com</a>.
