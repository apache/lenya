<page:title>It seems that Kupu is not installed on your server</page:title>
<page:body>
    <div class="lenya-box">
      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Users of the source version need to run 
        <code>make</code> in the Kupu root directory or <code>ant kupu</code> in the Apache Lenya source directory. </p>
      <p>Many thanks to the <a href="http://kupu.oscom.org">Kupu community</a> for making this 
        great tool available. </p>
