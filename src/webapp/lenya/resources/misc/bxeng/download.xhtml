<page:title>Loading BXE failed!</page:title>

<p>
It seems that either BXE is not installed or the wrong version of BXE is installed on your server (No such file bxeLoader.js).
</p>

<p>
Please <a href="http://bxe.oscom.org/download/">download BXE</a> (recommended version 1.0.x) and copy the
contents of the tarball to the <em>webapps/lenya/lenya/resources/bxeng</em> directory.
</p>

<p>
If you use Jetty, copy the contents of the tarball to the <em>build/lenya/webapps/lenya/resources/bxeng</em> directory.
</p>

<p>
No further setup is required.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks to the <a href="http://bxe.oscom.org">BXE community</a> for making this great tool available.
