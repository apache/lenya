<h3>It seems that BXENG is not installed on your server</h3>
Lenya is expecting a bxeng directory within your webapps ROOT directory.
<br />
<br />Please download and install BXENG as follows
<br /><br />
<code>cd $TOMCAT/webapps/ROOT</code>
<br />
<code>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bitflux.ch:/var/lib/cvs/editor co bxeng</code>
<br /><br />
(No password required)
<p>
That's it :-)
<br /><br />
Many thanks to the <a href="http://www.bitfluxeditor.org">Bitflux Editor community</a> for making this great tool available.
