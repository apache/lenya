<h2>Frontpage</h2>
<h3>Headlines</h3>
<p>When an article is published, it is inserted in the frontpage (headlines). The article is inserted at the top of the headlines, except if it is already on the frontpage. 
</p>
<p>Evry article should have an image. If it has no one, a message "Attention, no image" appears in authoring. The article can anyway be published.
