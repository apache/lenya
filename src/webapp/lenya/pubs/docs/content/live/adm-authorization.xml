You can use this publisher when you run everything on one
machine. Everything means the administrator's view, the editor's view
and the reader's view. In a more "productive" environment it is recommended
to run the administrator's and editor's view on one machine (intranet) and
the reader's view on another machine (DMZ). In this case you have to use a
more advanced publisher, which is able to replicate the data by scp, rysnc (ssh)
or for instance http-upload.

The filesystem publisher has to know the filesystem path of the authoring area and
the live area. These two paths are set within the sitemap:

     <source><![CDATA[

<map:actions>
  <map:action name="" src="">
    <authoring href="docs/publication/authoring/"/>
    <live href="docs/publication/live/"/>
    <tree-authoring href="docs/publication/authoring/tree.xml"/>
    <tree-live href="docs/publication/live/tree.xml"/>
  </map:action>
</map:actions>

     ]]></source>
   <p>
NOTE: "authoring" and "live" are required parameters, "tree-authoring" and "tree-live" are not required parameters.
