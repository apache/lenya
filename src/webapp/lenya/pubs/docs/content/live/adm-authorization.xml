       	<s2 title="Creating and Editing Users (Command Line)">
	<p>
	Creating and editing users on the command line depends on
	the concrete authenticator used by the publication. You can find
	out which authenticator is used by taking a look at the sitemaps of
	the publication. The default authenticator is currently the IML-Authenticator.
	</p>

		<s3 title="IML-Authenticator">
		<p>
		"IML" stands for Identity Markup Language. Each user is defined by an IML-file.
		For example, the user "wyona" is defined by the file "wyona.iml". The IML-files are
		normally located at MY_PUB/docs/wyona/cms/ac/passwd, where MY_PUB is not the string
		"MY_PUB", but rather the filesystem path under which "My Publication" is located, for instance
		"wyona/cms/pubs/ethz-mat". To create a new user, just copy an existing one. The new user
		will have the same password as the one you have copied. To create a new MD5 encrypted password
		you can use the Java class <code>org.wyona.cms.ac.Password</code>, which is using 
		the Java class <code>org.w3c.tools.crypt.Md5</code> (The classes can be found at WEB-INF/classes).

	<s2 title="Editing Authorization Policies (Command Line)">
	<p>
	Creating and editing policies/permissions on the command line depends on
	the concrete authorizer used by the publication. You can find
	out which authorizer is used by taking a look at the sitemaps of
	the publication. The default authorizer is currently the PML-Authorizer.
	</p>

		<s3 title="PML-Authorizer">
		<p>
		"PML" stands for "Policy Markup Language". The PML-Authorizer is matching each HTTP-request
		with an action (i.e. read, write, publish, etc.) and a policy (permissions). The rules for matching are
		defined by the sitemap "policies-sitemap.xmap". This sitemap is normally located in 
		the "root" directory (MY_PUB) of each publication. The policies themselves can normally be found
		at <code>MY_PUB/docs/wyona/cms/ac/policies</code>.
