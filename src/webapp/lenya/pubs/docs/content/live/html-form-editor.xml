<s1 title="Wyona's HTML Form Editor">

    <p>The Wyona HTML Form Editor allows to edit the content of XML files
    within the Web browser. It's only assumption is, that the browser
    understands HTML forms and &lt;input&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt;
    tags. Therefore it should be usable under any browser.</p> 

    <p>The type of editor field to be used, as well as any options concerning
    the width and heigth, are declared in a descriptor file, accompanying the
    XML file to be edited. This descriptior file allows to declare the minimum
    and maximum number of XML-tags of the same name within the hierarchy.
    </p>

<s2 title="Example">
    <p>For example we have a "member" document "elvis.xml" of the form</p>

      <day></day>

    <p>The corresponding <b>edit descriptor</b> has the form</p>

<source>
<![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<member> 
  <person>
    <name editType="form" size="30"  name="Name"/>
    <prename editType="form" size="30" maxOccurs="5" name="Prename"/>
    <birthday>
      <year editType="form"/>
      <month editType="form"/>
      <day editType="form"/>
    </birthday>
  </person>
  <curriculum editType="text" width="50" height="7">
  <contact>
    <address>
      <street editType="form"/>
      <town editType="form"/>
    </address>
    <emails >
      <email editType="form" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
    </emails>
  </contact>
</member>
]]>
</source>
    <p>Comparing both files, we see that the edit descriptor is simply the
    "member" XML file with empty tags. The attributes declare how to XML-tags
    are to be edited, namely:</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>attribute</th>
        <th>possible values</th>
        <th>notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>        
        <td>editType</td>
        <td>"text", "form", "show"</td>
        <td>default: nothing is shown</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>        
        <td>minOccurs</td>
        <td>"0","1","2","3",...</td>
        <td>default if not given: 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>        
        <td>maxOccurs</td>
        <td>"1","2","3",..., "unbounded"</td>
        <td>default if not given: 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>        
        <td>name</td>
        <td>"any name you like"</td>
        <td>will be displayed instead of tag name</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>All other attributes are provided unchanged to the input field. One
    could say, that the edit-descriptor is some sort of XML-Schema or DTD. It
    should be straightforward to use a XML-Schema for the same purpose, if
    the appropriate editing keywords are added. </p>

<s2 title="Inserting XHTML content">
    <p>Some input fields, namely those of type="text", allow the user to embed XHTML tags in their
    content, allowing them to influence the representation of the text somewhat, and to provide
    links to the page, in a relatively free style.</p>
    <p>This feature creates also the possibility of the user writing incorrect (non-XML) content, and
    thus endangering the stability of the application. To guard against this danger, the content of all
    input fields is checked for well-formedness, and an error message is displayed if there is 
    incorrect markup embedded, while the content is not allowed to be saved.</p>
    <p>The check for well-formedness is executed from whithin EditorMainAction.java, before the file gets 
    saved, and checks the whole xml content of the file to be saved. This is probably overkill, and in 
    a future iteration of the development, could be reduced to check only the fields that allow 
    XHTML content. This could be done by ways of providing a method for checking the xml in a utility class,
    and calling it only when it is needed.</p>
    <p>Also, the check for well-formedness is implemented by means of the Cocoon API, and uses the parser
    that is defined as the parser for Cocoon, which makes it easy to change it (in the cocoon.xconf). However,
    the Cocoon API does not provide means to get very specific messages as to what the error is, and where it 
    is located in the source document, as it throws a org.xml.sax.SAXException, instead of a 
    org.xml.sax.SAXParseException, which would provide more information. This might change in the future,
    but until then, only a generic error message can be displayed to the user, which is, at the moment, hardcoded
    in the stylesheet body.xsl, and is displayed on top of the edit page. This problem could be somewhat
    defused by parsing element-wise, as decribed in the previous paragraph, and providing the error message
    located together with the element causing the problem.</p>

<s2 title="How it works">
  <p>  The editor relies on a series of pipes and actions defined in the
   <code>html-form-editor.xmap</code> sitemap.</p>
