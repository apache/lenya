<s2 title="What is the role of Cocoon">
<p>
At the moment Cocoon is used as XML Publishing Framework. Cocoon's "pipeline processor"
controls the interaction between XML and XSLT and provides a mechanismn to map requests to pipelines.
More information can be found at the Cocoon <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">website</link>.
</p>
</s2>

<s2 title="What is the role of Slide">
<p>
Slide provides a Content Management Framework based on a Java API, which
is similar to <link href="http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/170.jsp">JSR 170</link>.
It can be used as a Data Abstraction Layer accessing various types of content repositories.
Slide has implemented a WebDAV servlet which iteracts with Slide's CM API.
More information can be found at the Slide <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/">website</link>.
</p>
</s2>

<s2 title="What is the role of Wyona">
<p>
Wyona had it's own "Pipeline and XInclude Processor" when it was started in autumn 1999.
In the meantime Cocoon and Slide have emerged and developed into powerful frameworks.
Wyona started to integrate Cocoon's pipeline processor at the end of 2001.
In order to base Wyona on a generic Content Management API we are currently discussing
how to integrate Slide.
Beside the features of Cocoon and Slide,
there are still many features needed to provide a usable Content Management System.
Wyona is providing the following additional features:
<ol>
<li>Authoring/Staging user interfaces for authors and editors</li>
<li>Administrator interface (User/Group/Policies management, Monitoring, etc.)</li>
<li>Resource/Content Creator implementations</li>
<li>Editor interfaces for not WebDAV enabled editors such Xopus and Bitflux</li>
<li>Rudimentary HTML Form Editor as fallback</li>
<li>Scheduler</li>
<li>Workflow Manager</li>
<li>Framework for Publications</li>
<li>Dependency Manager</li>
<li>Notifier/Dispatcher/Subscriber pattern (Event Monitoring, JMS!)</li>
<li>Publisher/Replicator</li>
<li>Access Controlling (Wyona and Cocoon and Slide have each it's own Access Controller!)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>
