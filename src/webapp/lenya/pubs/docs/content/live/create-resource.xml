    <s1 title="Introduction">
<p>
There are many different ways to create respectively import content into 
a Content Management System. You can upload an image, you can create a document
based on some form input or you can create a document by copying a sample document.
The following use cases shall illustrate some possible situations in more detail.
The goal is to develop a generic API for resource creation.
