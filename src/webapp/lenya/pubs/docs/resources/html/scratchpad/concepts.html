<h3>Roles of the Lenya users</h3>
<p align="justify">
  All users of the Lenya-CMS have roles assigned to their usernames. These roles 
  are the basis of the authorization scheme used throughout the application. The roles
  and their respective authorizations are totally customizable through an
  administration panel.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  All roles belong to one of these main groups:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#roles_admin">Administrators</a></li>
  <li><a href="#roles_author">Authors</a></li>
  <li><a href="#roles_designer">Designers</a></li>
  <li><a href="#roles_publisher">Publishers</a></li>
</ol>

<a name="roles_admin"></a>
<h4>Administrators</h4>
<p align="justify">
  Administrators are responsible for:
  <ul>
    <li>Maintaining users and their profiles (e.g. assigned roles)</li>
    <li>Maintaining the site/publication description</li>
    <li>Maintaining page descriptions</li>
    <li>Configuring the Lenya-CMS:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Assigning editors to edit tasks</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  For most/all of these tasks, specific configuration pages are provided
  whithin the Lenya-CMS's <i>Administration Block</i> to shield the 
  administrator from the internals of xml/xsl technologies and the
  Cocoon environment.
</p>

<a name="roles_author"></a>
<h4>Authors</h4>
<p align="justify">
  Authors are the users responsible for content creation and management, they use
  the specific editors to maintain the content in a controlled and consistant way.
  Typically, authors are never confronted with design choices and/or xml/xsl documents, 
  they only work whithin the Lenya-CMS environment, i.e. a www-browser. The content
  is first placed in a staging context, waiting for a <a href="#roles_publisher">
  publisher</a> to publish it so that it can be viewed by external viewers of
  the publication.
</p>

<a name="roles_designer"></a>
<h4>Designers</h4>
<p align="justify">
  Designers are users responsible for maintaining the layout and style of the
  publication. Typically, they work directly with the xsl and css files
  used to transform the publication for presentation (e.g. in a browser), as
  well as the required graphic files. All these files are located in a separate
  branch of the application tree for convenience (see also 
  <a href="#directories">Directory structure</a> below). To simplify the 
  designer's work, a <i>"publication explorer"</i> could be provided, that helps
  to navigate the publishing tree (by reading sitedef.xml) and to identify the content
  files and their structure (by reading the page descriptor files), and that 
  can be linked to any xml/xsl-editor.
</p>

<a name="roles_publisher"></a>
<h4>Publishers</h4>
<p align="justify">
  Publishers are users that have permission to add staged content to the live
  publication. This role group is primarily introduced for workflow management
  purposes. In practice, publisher roles will be combined with author roles to 
  model the workflow of the content management environment, allowing for reviewing
  and editing activities.
</p>

<a name="config"></a>
<h3>Configuration and Customization</h3>
<p align="justify">
  All configuration files have their own living spaces both in the generic 
  Lenya-CMS directory and the specific publication directory. All configuration
  information that is not supplied explicitly in the publication directory is
  inherited from the CMS directory, where default behaviour is defined.
</p>

<a name="editing"></a>
<h3>Making content editable</h3>
<p align="justify">To edit the content managed by the CMS, several types and brands
of editors can (and will) be used. The best way to provide editor connectivity would be 
to provide an "editor socket", where different editors can plug in. This socket should
be generic and as standardized as possible. One way to do this would be to provide
an interface based on the MVC design: the content to be edited is presented to the editor
as a triplet of xml, xsl and xsd data, representing content, style and structure, respectively.
Some more details:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Content (XML):</b> This is the content to be edited, and could be an XML, XSL or 
  XSD content, depending on the role of the editor; e.g. the designer, that needs to edit XSL
  content, will call an editor to edit a stylesheet, and the contents of the stylesheet to be edited
  are sent to this editor as the Content (or XML) part of the call. As all of XML, XSL and XSD files
  are actually XML files, this is straightforward.</li>
  <li><b>Style (XSL):</b> This stylesheet will provide information for the representaion of the content
  in the <b>editor</b>. If the content to be edited is an XML file, this stylesheet might be
  very similar or even identical to the stylesheet used for "normal" representation of this content,
  but, in principle, could be something totally different, a stylesheet prepared only for editing purposes,
  that represents the content of the first file in a way to the editor, that makes most sense for it's
  editing. An example: if the file (content, the first file in the triplet) to be edited was a 
  stylesheet itself, this stylesheet (style, the second file in the triplet) could be used to group
  and highlight stylesheet elements visually, to make editing them easier.</li>
  <li><b>Structure (XSD):</b> This file is a schema, providing information about the structure of the
  content to be edited to the editor, so that the edited contents can be validated.</li>
</ul>
