<h1>The Wyona-CMS Scratchpad</h1>

<p align="justify">
  These documents are for keeping track of the road ahead, as well as providing
  a discussion base for issues encountered during the refactoring of the 
  Wyona XPS (as used for <a href="http://www.nzz.ch">NZZ Online</a>) to
  the Wyona CMS, which is based on open standards, especially 
  <a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon">Cocoon</a>, an XML publishing 
  framework being developped by the <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache
  Software Foundation</a>. They serve as to-do lists and 
  path descriptions for the developpers, as well as a digest of the <a 
  href="http://www.wyona.org/mailing-list.html" 
  target="_self">Wyona mailing list</a>). Of course, most of what is on this
  scratchpad is still open to discussion, and everybody is invited to contribute.
