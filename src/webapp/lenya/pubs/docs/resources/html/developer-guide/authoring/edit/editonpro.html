<h1>RealObjects edit-on Pro Editor</h1>
<p>
Unfortunately this editor is not Open Source, but 
you will find a trial version at <a href="http://www.realobjects.de">http://www.realobjects.de</a>.
</p>
<p>
You have to place the "edit-on Pro" code into some directory of your web-server.<br>
For instance: <code>$PREFIX/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/webapps/ROOT/editonpro</code>
</p>

<p>
Then you have to tell the CMS where it can find this code. In the case of the
Materials Science Publication this is done by an XSLT-variable:
<code>$PREFIX/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/webapps/wyona-cms/wyona/cms/pubs/ethz-mat/stylesheets/Configuration/read.xsl</code>
