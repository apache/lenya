<h2>Creating and Editing Users (Command Line)</h2>
<p>
Creating and editing users on the command line depends on
the concrete authenticator used by the publication. You can find
out which authenticator is used by taking a look at the sitemaps of
the publication. The default authenticator is currently the IML-Authenticator.
</p>

<h3>IML-Authenticator</h3>
<p>
"IML" stands for Identity Markup Language. Each user is defined by an IML-file.
For example, the user "wyona" is defined by the file "wyona.iml". The IML-files are
normally located at MY_PUB/docs/wyona/cms/ac/passwd, where MY_PUB is not the string
"MY_PUB", but rather the filesystem path under which "My Publication" is located, for instance
"wyona/cms/pubs/ethz-mat". To create a new user, just copy an existing one. The new user
will have the same password as the one you have copied. To create a new MD5 encrypted password
you can use the Java class <code>org.lenya.cms.ac.Password</code>, which is using 
the Java class <code>org.w3c.tools.crypt.Md5</code> (The classes can be found at WEB-INF/classes).

<h2>Editing Authorization Policies (Command Line)</h2>
<p>
Creating and editing policies/permissions on the command line depends on
the concrete authorizer used by the publication. You can find
out which authorizer is used by taking a look at the sitemaps of
the publication. The default authorizer is currently the PML-Authorizer.
</p>

<h3>PML-Authorizer</h3>
<p>
"PML" stands for "Policy Markup Language". The PML-Authorizer is matching each HTTP-request with an action (i.e. read, write, publish, etc.) and a policy (permissions). The rules for matching are
defined by the sitemap "policies-sitemap.xmap". This sitemap is normally located in 
the "root" directory (MY_PUB) of each publication. The policies themselves can normally be found
at <code>MY_PUB/docs/wyona/cms/ac/policies</code>.
</p>

<h3>XACML-Authorizer</h3>
<p>
Not implemented yet. More information on XACML can be found <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xacml/">here</a>.
