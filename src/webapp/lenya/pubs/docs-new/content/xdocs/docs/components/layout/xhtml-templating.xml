<section><title>The XHTML Templating Concept</title> 
<p>There are various approaches to templating within a Lenya
publication. The XHTML approach is effective under the following
conditions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designers want to edit the layout with their conventional tools.</li> 
<li>The page layout contains large parts of static HTML.</li>
<li>Pages are typically composed of simple elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If these conditions are met, it is possible to define the overall
layout of a page in a XHTML document, using tools like Dreamweaver.
Special placeholders need to be inserted to indicate where Lenya
elements should later be substituted. This can be done by inserting
&lt;div id="navigation" /&gt; as the placeholder for the navigation, for
instance, or &lt;div id="cmsbody" /&gt; for the body part of a page.
</p><p>
If these XHTML documents are finished, they can then be called
from Lenya, and the placeholders be substituted with CMS content.
Schematically, this process looks as follows:
</p>
<p>1)</p>

<p>XML document (article)    -&gt;</p>
<p>XML document (navigation) -&gt;  Aggregation to one XML document</p>
<p>XHTML template            -&gt;</p> 

<p>2)</p>

<p>aggregated XML document   -&gt;  Processing with XSLT</p>
<p>
Step 2) identifies the various placeholders ( &lt;div id="navigation" /&gt;
and &lt;div id="cmsbody" /&gt; in this example) and applies XSL transformations
to substitute the placeholders with the transformed contents of
(navigation, article) respectively.
</p><p>
What are the advantages of this approach?</p>
<ul>
  <li>less XSLT is required, making it easier to delegate design work</li>
<li>XSLT are easier to understand, as they only affect a small part
  of a page</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the pitfalls of this approach?</p>
<ul>
  <li>it may not be appropriate to put the content (here: article) into
  the XHTML format</li>
<li>template reuse may be hampered</li>
</ul>
