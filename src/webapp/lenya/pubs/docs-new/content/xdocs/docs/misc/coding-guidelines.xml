      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
	We use coding standards to be able to write code easy to
	understand, to maintain, and to enhance.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Java Code</title>
      <p>
	Generally we stick with standards. In the case of coding
	standards we simply use the guidelines from Sun.
      </p>
      <p>
	Here are the rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thou shalt only produce code conforming to the Java code
        conventions, as they are set down on the page <link
        href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html">http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html</link>
        <p/>
        </li>
        <li>Thou shalt not produce any code containing tab-stops.
        <p/>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>XML and XSP</title>
      <p>
	The only restriction we impose on XML, XSLT and XSP code is
	that the indenting is 2 spaces. Again please no tab stops.
      </p>
