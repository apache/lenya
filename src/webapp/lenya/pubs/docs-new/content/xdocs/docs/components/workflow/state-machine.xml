<section><title>Invoking a Transition</title>
<p>
When an event <em>e</em> is invoked on a workflow instance <em>I</em>, the following
algorithm is executed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The current state <em>s<sub>current</sub></em> is determined.</li>
  <li>The transition <em>t</em> from <em>s<sub>current</sub></em> to <em>s<sub>next</sub></em>
      which has the event <em>e</em> is determined.</li>
  <li>If <em>t</em> is not exactly defined, an exception is thrown.</li>
  <li>All conditions of <em>t</em> are validated.</li>
  <li>If all conditions are complied, the transition <em>t</em> fires:
  <ul>
    <li>All assignments of <em>t</em> are executed.</li>
    <li>The workflow instance <em>I</em> is advanced to the state <em>s<sub>next</sub></em>.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
