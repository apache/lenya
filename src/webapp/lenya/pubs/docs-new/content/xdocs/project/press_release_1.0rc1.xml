The Apache Lenya development community is very proud to announce the
long-awaited first stable release candidate 1 (1.0rc1) of Apache Lenya.

http://www.apache.org/dist/cocoon/lenya/

Apache Lenya is the new CMS project under the Apache umbrella. The
codebase (formerly known as Wyona CMS) was donated to the Apache
Software Foundation by Wyona Ltd in May 2003.

Apache Lenya is a Java Open-Source Content Management System based on
open standards such as XML and XSLT and the Apache Software Stack. Its
XML-centric architecture allows for content delivery targeted to the
capabilities of the devices of today and tomorrow, and avoids data
lock-in as with proprietary solutions. Apache Lenya is built around Off
the Shelf components from the Apache Software Foundation, which are
familiar to thousands of technologists, and are documented extensively
in dozens of books.

The Apache Software Stack is quickly becoming the preeminent platform
for building Internet applications. By leveraging the Apache Software
Stack, Apache Lenya offers a robust, future-proof solution that reserves
technology investments.

Apache Lenya comes with the features you would expect of a modern
Content Management System, such as Revision Control, Scheduling, a
built-in Search Engine, seperate Staging Areas, and Workflow. Because
Apache Lenya uses XML throughout, it can offer much more than other CMS
that marginally use XML.

Some notable features include:

* Browser-based WYSIWYG Editors that validate input against a W3C XML
Schema. This prevents invalid markup as produced by other editors,
and allows to enforce web site style guidelines.

* A publication concept that allows reuse of the information
architecture of a site and brings modularity to the content level.


"As an IT Trade Magazine, we care about independence" says Wolfgang
Boehler from Computerworld Switzerland, "it increases our credibility.
That is why we chose Apache Lenya for our site, and why we intend to
build on that first step."

"Having been personally obsessed for years for the quest for the
perfect Content Management Framework, I am very happy to see Lenya
seeding this on top of Cocoon technology." says Stefano Mazzocchi,
founder of the Apache Cocoon project, and adds: "The Apache Lenya
effort has to be seen as a powerful software seed for the creation
of a solid, healthy and diverse development community around the
problems of Content Management, but following the Cocoon philosophy
that we provide frameworks and toolkits and you build the stuff
you need."


This release of Apache Lenya is a refactored version of the codebase
that has been in production at major sites such as Neue Zuercher Zeitung
(www.nzz.ch) and the University of Zurich (www.unipublic.unizh.ch) for
nearly three years. Wyona Ltd donated the Apache Lenya codebase
(formerly known as Wyona CMS) to the Apache Software Foundation in
May 2003.
