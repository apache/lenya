Lenya CMS is an <link href="http://www.opensource.org">Open-Source</link>
Content Management and Publishing System written in 100% pure Java. It
is based on open standards such as <link href="http://www.w3c.org/XML/">XML</link> and <link
href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</link>. One of its core
components is <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">Cocoon</link> from the
<link href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</link>.
</p>

<p>
Lenya is an interpreter of various XMLs, not just
user's data, such as for instance articles, press-releases or addresses,
but also regarding functionalities, such as for instance
access controlling (IML and PML resp. <link href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xacml/">XACML</link>), 
revision controlling (RCML)
or workflow management (WFML).
The network is the CMS.
</p>

<p>
Lenya supports inline WYSIWYG editing, which means users (authors/editors) do
not have to learn (or see) XML. This is possible thanks to the support
of XML, XSLT and XML Schema on the client side, such is the case
for certain browsers (Mozilla/Netscape or IE).
But there also exists the "Lenya Administrator" for the more
advanced user, where the CMS can be monitored, XML can be edited
directly or authentication and authorization can be managed.
