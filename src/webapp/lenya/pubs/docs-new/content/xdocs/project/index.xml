Apache Lenya is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation, sponsored by the ASF's Cocoon project. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

		<p>
Apache Lenya is a Java-based <link href="http://www.opensource.org">Open-Source</link>
Content Management System. It
is based on open standards such as <link href="http://www.w3c.org/XML/">XML</link> and <link href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</link>. One of its core
components is <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</link> from the
<link href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</link>.
</p>
		<p>
Lenya supports inline WYSIWYG editors. Your site editors do
not have to learn XML. This is possible thanks to the support
of XML, XSLT and XML Schema on the client side.
An adminstration interface allows advanced users to
monitor the CMS, and perform configuration tasks.
