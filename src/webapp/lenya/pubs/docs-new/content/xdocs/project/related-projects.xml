<section><title>Cocoon</title>
<p>
Apache Cocoon is an XML publishing framework that raises the usage of XML and XSLT
technologies for server applications to a new level. Designed for performance and
scalability around pipelined SAX processing, Cocoon offers a flexible environment
based on a separation of concerns between content, logic, and style. To top this all
off, Cocoons centralized configuration system and sophisticated caching help you to
create, deploy, and maintain rock-solid XML server applications.

<section><title>Slide</title>
<p>
The Slide project main module is a Content Management and Integration System, which
can be seen as a low-level content management framework. Conceptually, it provides
a hierarchical organization of binary content which can be stored into arbitrary,
heterogenous, distributed data stores. In addition, Slide integrates security, locking,
versioning, as well as many other services.
