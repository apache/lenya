This directory contains XML schemas which describe the various XML formats used
in Forrest.

The schemas are written in RELAX NG, a schema language devised by James Clark,
SGML boffin, XML inventor and all-round smart guy.

RELAX NG is widely regarded to be the simplest, most powerful, and easy to
learn schema language available.

Jing RELAX NG validator in Java:

To run an XML file against a .rng schema using Jing, see the
"validate-config" target in xml-forrest/build.xml or do this:

java -jar $FORREST_HOME/WEB-INF/lib/jing.jar [.rng file] [.xml file]

If you're running JDK 1.3.x or lower, you'll need to add
$FORREST_HOME/lib/endorsed/*.jar to your classpath first.
