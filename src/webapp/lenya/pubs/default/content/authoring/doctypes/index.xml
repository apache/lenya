    <h1>Document Type Examples</h1>

    <p>The default publication comes with two doctypes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="doctypes/simple-document.html">Simple Doctype</a> and </li>
      <li>the <a href="doctypes/xhtml-document.html">XHTML Doctype</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Simple Doctype is typically used for situations when you
    want control over what information has to be included in a
    document. The Simple Document defines a set of tags that a
    document has to be comprised of.</p>

    <p>The XHTML Doctype on the other hand is for situations where
    users ask for complete freedom on what information can be inserted
    into a document. While this approach doesn't restrict you, it also
    looses some of the major benefits of well defined document types.</p>
