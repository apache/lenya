    <h1>Document Type Examples</h1>

    <p>The default publication comes with the <a href="doctypes/xhtml-document.html">XHTML Doctype</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The XHTML Doctype is for situations where
    users ask for complete freedom on what information can be inserted
    into a document. While this approach doesn't restrict you, it also
    looses some of the major benefits of well defined document types.</p>
