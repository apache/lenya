    <h1>Tutorial</h1>

    <p>This tutorial gives you a short introduction into the Apache
    Lenya content management system. We'll look at a typical use case
    where we create a new document, edit and publish it.</p>

    <p>It's probably best if you keep the tutorial in one browser
    window and <a target="_blank" href="">open another browser
    window</a> to do your first steps in Apache Lenya CMS</p>

    <h2>Creating a new document</h2>

    <p>To create a new document goto the <code>File->New
    Document</code> menu entry. You'll get a new screen that asks you
    for an id and a name for this new document. The id will be used
    internally as an identifier for the document and the name will be
    used in the navigation. Let's use "foo" as id and "Foo" as the
    name of the new document. Now press <code>Create</code>. You will
    be redirected back to the page where you originally invoked the
    creation and you'll notice that the new document "Foo" now shows
    up as a sub-document of the Tutorial document in the
    navigation.</p>

    <p>This illustrates the fact that a new document is always created
    as a sub-document of the document you're currently looking at. You
    also notice how the navigation is built automatically.</p>

    <h2>Editing a document</h2>

    <p>To look at the newly created document click on the "Foo" entry
    in the navigation. You'll notice that the "Foo" document already
    contains some content. It was created from a sample XML
    document. To change this sample content you will have to edit the
    document. You can pick on of the following web-based WYSIWYG
    editors:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Xopus: This is a good choice for users of IE.</li>
      <li>Bitflux: This is a good choice for users of Mozilla.</li>
      <li>Midas: is a good choice for editing xhtml under Mozilla.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pick your choice of editor (based on your platform) and start
    editing the newly created document by selecting the
    <code>File->Edit with Bitflux</code>. The Lenya menu will
    disappear and the Bitflux toolbar will appear instead. You can use
    the left mouse button to get a context sensitive menu from where
    you can copy, cut and paste. You're also able to insert new
    elements into the document from the context sensitive menu. Once
    you're done with all your changes, press
    <code>Save&amp;Exit</code> to get back. You'll see your changes in
    the document.</p>

    <h2>Publishing a document</h2>

    <p>Once you are satisfied with the content of the document you
    want to publish it to make it visible in the live area. Simply
    press <code>File->Publish</code> to publish the current
    document. You will get a confirmation screen where you confirm
    your intention to publish the document "Foo" by pressing
    <code>Publish Now</code>. You might have to publish the parent
    document ("Tutorial") first, as the "Foo" document will not be
    published if the parent document is not in the live area yet.</p>
    <p>To check how the "Foo" document looks like in the live site
    click on the <code>live</code> tab in the Lenya menu. This will
    open a new browser window showing you the live site.</p>
    
    <h2>Scheduling</h2>
    
    <p>Apache Lenya allows you to publish a document at a specific
    date. To do this select the <code>File->Publish</code> menu
    entry. Now instead of pressing <code>Publish Now</code>, specify
    the date and the time at which you wish to publish the document
    and press <code>Publish Later</code>. Your document will be
    published at the specified date. Use the
    <code>Tools->Scheduler</code> menu entry to see the pending tasks
    and their status.</p>

    <h2>Revision Control</h2>

    <p>Every time you edit a document and exit the editor a new
    revision of the document is stored. Old versions of the document
    are kept and you can go back to an older version if you want to
    undo some of the changes you applied to it. To see all available
    versions of the current document press
    <code>Tools->Rollback</code>. This will give you a list of all
    previous versions. You can view a specific old version or rollback
    to a specific old version by clicking on the appropriate links.</p>
