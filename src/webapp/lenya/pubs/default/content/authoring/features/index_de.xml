    <h1>Funktionen</h1>

    <p>Apache Lenya comes with the features you would expect of a
    modern Content Management System, such as Revision Control,
    Scheduling, a built-in Search Engine, separate Staging Areas and
    Workflow. Because Apache Lenya uses XML throughout, it can offer
    much more than other CMS that use XML only marginally. Some
    notable features include:</p>

    <h2>Browser-based WYSIWYG Editing</h2>
    
    <p>Apache Lenya comes with Browser-based WYSIWYG Editors that
    validate input against a W3C XML Schema. This prevents the invalid
    markup that other editors produce. Schema-based editors also allow
    to enforce web site style guidelines.</p> 

    <h2>XML Publishing</h2>

    <p>As Apache Lenya is based on Apache Cocoon it leverages all the
    benefits from a powerful XML Publishing framework such as
    multi-channel publishing, content aggregation even from external
    sources such as RSS.</p>

    <h2>The Publication Concept</h2>
    
    <p>The publication concept allows for reuse of the information
    architecture of a site and brings modularity to the content
    level.</p> 

    <h2>Future-proof Solution</h2>
    
    <p>The Apache Software Stack is quickly becoming the preeminent
    platform for building Internet applications. By leveraging the
    Apache Software Stack, Apache Lenya offers a robust, future-proof
    solution that preserves technology investments.</p>
