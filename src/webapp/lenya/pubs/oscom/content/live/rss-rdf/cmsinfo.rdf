phpWebsite is an excellent open source CMS to look at as an alternate to phpNuke (possibly postNuke). I believe phpWebsite is based on phpNuke with the goal to optimize the code base (as they see it) and make it more stable. It is a project created and maintained by students at Appalachian State.

      Submission by Tim Slavin

Just a quick review about this weblog/CMS tool, pMachine (http://www.pmachine.com).


This tool requires PHP/MySQL. It has great functionality (e.g., templates, member only pages, calendar, publish forward, multiple levels of access). There is also great support online; they don't ignore your questions. It is easy to customize and includes a descriptive manual and tags (functions) that can be dropped into pages and configured. The tool also allows you to use human readable URLs (instead of querystrings). The install is also very easy and web-ified.

GerdauAmeriSteel's Jackson, TN Steel Mill has been using WebGUI to manage the content of their in-plant website since the early 3.x.x versions. As the capabilities of WebGUI have grown, so have the applications for which we use it.

I work at a large technology company and I'm the "fix-it" guy. So I spend a lot of time (which doesn't count as my job) helping out others. I noticed (as anyone else who does this would) that it was frequently the same set of questions. I tried for over a year to get interns or internal resources to get website up to contain this information. Although there was a webserver and official support, it was just too much work and updates took months or never got done (some parts of the "official" website were three years out of date). Finally, in desperation, I went looking for CMS systems and found WebGUI. I spent a couple of days building a web server on a clean W2K box (cygwin, apache, perl, webgui). Afterwards I had a web site. It wasn't exactly pretty but it had most of the key information on it and best of all it was fast and easy to update from anywhere. Now when I fix a problem, I can throw the solution onto the site quickly immediately afterwards without having to wait for someone else to decide it's important. I've been training my co-workers to go to the site first and even if they don't, I can just send them a URL instead of having to retype the list of service packs required again. And we can download huge service packs once and put them in a standard place.
