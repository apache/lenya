<title>Content Management System</title>
<description>
A CMS is designed to manage documents resp. content by human beings and 
provides features such as: Access Control, Version Control, Workflows, Cross-Media Publishing Engine,
Separation of Content and Style, Authoring Tools, Search Engine, etc.
The term content management system, as opposed to document management system, reflects
the fact that such systems generally allow you to break your documents into
discrete content fragments, such as examples, procedures, chapters, or sidebars, as
well as metadata, such as author names, revision dates, rather than having to
manage each document as a whole. Not only does this simplify such things as how to
coordinate the work of multiple writers working on the same document, it allows you
to assemble entirely new documents from existing components. (Source: <a href="http://www.rpbourret.com/xml/XMLAndDatabases.htm#cms">Ronald Bourret</a>)
