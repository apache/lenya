			<description>
For a web applications programmer who
has to develop complex enterprise level applications, web services or
multi language dynamic websites (Content Management Systems), Krysalis
is a development platform that improves the Apache/PHP framework by
separating the application logic from the presentation layer, using open
standards as XML/XSL/SOAP. Unlike any other application servers and
frameworks, our platform is an open source solution for productive web
development.
