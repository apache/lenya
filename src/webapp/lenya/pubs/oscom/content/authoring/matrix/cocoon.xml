<description>
Apache Cocoon is an XML publishing framework that raises the usage of XML and XSLT technologies for server applications to a new level. Designed for performance and scalability around pipelined SAX processing, Cocoon offers a flexible environment based on a separation of concerns between content, logic, and style. To top this all off, Cocoons centralized configuration system and sophisticated caching help you to create, deploy, and maintain rock-solid XML server applications.
