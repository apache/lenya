Slither is a Python based web application
development framework. It provides you an environment that helps construct
fully functional, powerful web applications with minimal effort, leveraging
the power of Python. By comparison to JSP, Servlets, Zope and ASPs, it has a
little bit of influence from each, but not nearly as heavy or complex.
