  <title>Revision Controller has been integrated</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
We finally integrated the Revision Controller, which is capable of
reserved check-in/out and rollbacks, where the rollback length can
be configured.

<p>
This Revision Controller is just a temporary solution, because
we will integrate Apache Slide within the near future and
replace our Revison Controller by Slide's version control.
