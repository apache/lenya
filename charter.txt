The Apache Lenya Project is a community project 
developing open source content management solutions. 

With strong foundations in XML-based server-side web application frameworks,
like Apache Cocoon, the Apache Lenya Project consists of a group of people 
that share common values on collaboration-intensive 
and community-based quality open source development. 

The Apache Lenya Project is proud to share these values with its parent organization: 
The Apache Software Foundation.

The mission of the Apache Lenya Project project is:
- to provide commercial-quality, high-performance, well-tested,
standards-based XML editing environments that are developed in an open and collaborative fashion.
- to add user-oriented functionality on top of the Cocoon framework and other Apache projects.
- to advance the state of the art of content management and structured text editing.
