The Apache Lenya Project is the open source community project developing 
Apache Lenya and Lenya-based content management solutions. 
With strong foundations in XML-based server-side web application frameworks, 
the Apache Cocoon Project consists of a group of people that share common values 
on collaboration-intensive and community-based quality open source development. 
The Apache Lenya Project is proud to share these values with its parent organization: 
The Apache Software Foundation.

The mission of the Apache Lenya Project project is:
- to provide commercial-quality, high-performance, well-tested,
standards-based XML editing environments that are developed in an open and collaborative fashion.
- to add user-oriented functionality on top of the cocoon framework and other apache projects.
- to advance the state of the art of content management and structured text editing.
